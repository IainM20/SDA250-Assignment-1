ANGLE ON: ODO PROUDFOOT is unable to suppress a chuckle. FRODO stands up in the cart as GANDALF reigns in the HORSE. FRODOGandalf ...

BAG END - DAYWIDE ON: GANDALF’S CART pulls up outside the gate to BAG END ... a particularly fine example of a HOBBIT HOLE, with a large round front door set into a grassy hillside. There is a sign on the gate which reads: “NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON PARTY BUSINESS.”GANDALF strides up the garden path of BAG END. He raises his staff and raps on the front door ... a voice calls out: BILBO (O.S.) No thank you! We don't want any morevisitors, well-wishers, or distant relations. GANDALFAnd what about very old friends? Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him. He is a HOBBIT OF INDETERMINATE AGE, with a mischeivous TWINKLE in his eye.

I’ve got a few bottle ofthe old WiBILBO disappears into the kitchen as GANDALF looks around ... enjoying the familiarity of BAG END ... he turns, knocking his head on the light and then walking into the wooden beam.

GANDALF smiles to himself.  18.CONTINUED: BILBO  Er, we’ve got raspberry jam and appletart ... got some custard somewhere. Notmuch for Afters, I’m afraid. Oh no ...we’re alright ...

I want to see mountains again ... mountains, Gandalf ... and then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book ... oh, Tea!GANDALF So, you mean to go through with yourplan, then? BILBO Yes, yes ... it’s all in hand. All the arrangements are made. GANDALF Frodo suspects something.BILBO ‘Course he does, he's a Baggins ... not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle! GANDALFYou will tell him, won't you? BILBO Yes, yes.GANDALF He’s very fond of you.BILBO I know. He’d probably come with me if I asked him. I think, in his heart, Frodo’s still in love with the Shire, the woods and the fields ... little rivers. BILBO stands gazing out of the kitchen window. BILBO   I am old, Gandalf... BILBO looks at GANDALF sadly...   20.CONTINUED: (3) BILBO   I know I don’t look it, but I’m beginning to feel it in my heart.CLOSE ON: BILBO’S fingers close around his waistcoat pocket ... gripping a small, unseen object.

Can you give it to them, Frodo?FRODO frowns.GANDALF   Do not be too eager to deal out deathin judgment ... even the very wise cannot see all ends.

HOBBITON - DAY \\n WIDE ON: The small VILLAGE OF HOBBITON is a quaint rustic \\nsettlement nestled amongst rolling green hills and large trees.  \\n The HOBBITS live in HOBBIT HOLES: neat burrows dug into the \\ngrassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens. \\n MONTAGE OF SHOTS UNDER BILBO: HOBBITS plowing fields ...smoking \\npipes ... serving food ... woodworking ... leading pigs ... \\nmilking cattle ... tidying their porches ... and of course, sleeping. \\n \\n      (CONTINUED) 9. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n     BILBO (V.O.)   “Hobbits have been living and farming in  \\n  the four Farthings of the Shire for many  \\n  hundreds of years, quite content to  \\n  ignore and be ignored by the world of  \\n  the Big Folk. Middle-earth being, after    all, full of strange creatures beyond  \\n  count, Hobbits must seem of little  \\n  importance being neither renowned as    great warriors nor counted among the  \\n  very wise.” \\n END MONTAGE \\n \\nINT.

The figure in the grass sits up ... looking straight \\nat CAMERA is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair and deep blue eyes. This is FRODO BAGGINS ... his EYES alight with \\nEXCITEMENT!

He arrives precisely \\nwhen he means to. \\n They look at each other for a moment ... then both start \\nlaughing as FRODO’S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to \\nthe front seat of the cart. \\n \\n     FRODO   It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf! \\n \\n      (CONTINUED) 12. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nNext to GANDALF, we see how small HOBBITS are ...

Tell me \\neverything. \\n \\nANGLE ON: GANDALF looks down at FRODO, a twinkle in his eye. \\n      GANDALF \\nWhat, everything? Far too eager and \\ncurious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural... Well, what can I tell you? Life in the \\nwide world goes on much as it has this \\npast age. Full of its own comings and goings, scarcely even aware of the \\nexistence of Hobbits... \\n \\nCLOSE ON: GANDALF as he surveys the peaceful scene before him. \\n      GANDALF (CONT’D) \\n  ...for which I am very thankful.  \\nSo, how is the old rascal? I hear this is to be a party of special \\nmagnificence. \\n      FRODO \\nYou know Bilbo.

He’s taken to locking himself in    his study. \\n 14. \\n \\n INT. BAG END STUDY - DAY \\n \\nCLOSE ON: BILBO picks up a MAP of Middle Earth.  \\n     FRODO (V.O.) \\n  He spends hours poring over old maps  \\n  when he thinks I’m not looking. \\n ANGLE ON: BILBO folds the map and puts it down. He pats his \\npants pockets. Suddenly, he looks worried. He pulls his pockets  \\ninside.  \\n     BILBO \\n   (worried)   Where’s it gone? \\n \\nQUICK CUTS: BILBO desperately searches for something...under cushions ... in pockets ... through coats ...  \\n \\nANGLE ON: He shoves his hands into his vest pockets, and stops \\n... relieved... \\n CLOSE ON: He removes his hand from his pocket ... his missing \\nitem clenched tightly in his fist ... he holds it to his mouth, \\ngrateful to have not lost it.  \\n      CUT TO: \\n EXT. HOBBITON FIELDS - DAY \\n \\n     FRODO \\n  He's up to something.  \\n FRODO shoots a knowing look, as GANDALF averts his eyes. \\n \\n     FRODO \\nAll right, then, keep your secrets. \\n \\n   GANDALF What? \\n \\n   FRODO But I know you have something to do \\nwith it. \\n \\n   GANDALF \\nGood gracious, me.  \\n    (CONTINUED) 15. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n   FRODO Before you came along, we Bagginses \\nwere very well thought of.  \\n \\n   GANDALF \\nIndeed?  \\n   FRODO \\nNever had any adventures or did anything unexpected. \\n \\n     GANDALF \\nIf you're referring to the incident \\nwith the Dragon ... I was barely \\ninvolved ...all I did was give your uncle a little nudge out the door. \\n \\n     FRODO \\nWhatever you did ... you’ve been \\nofficially labeled a disturber of the peace. \\n \\n   GANDALF Oh, really? \\n \\nANGLE ON: ODO PROUDFOOT looks up as the CART passes by, deeply suspicious. \\n \\n      CUT TO: \\n \\nEXT. HOBBITON - DAY  \\nCRANE UP: EXCITED CHILDREN, chasing after the cart. \\n CLOSE ON: GANDALF ignores the children’s cries. The children \\nstand deflated, watching GANDALF disappear up the lane.  \\n AT THAT MOMENT: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out \\nof the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children. \\n ANGLE ON: GANDALF smiling to himself, well pleased with his \\njoke. \\n \\nANGLE ON: ODO PROUDFOOT is unable to suppress a chuckle.  \\n FRODO stands up in the cart as GANDALF reigns in the HORSE. \\n \\n     FRODO   Gandalf ... I'm glad you're back. \\n \\n      (CONTINUED) 16. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nFRODO leaps expertly from the cart.

BAG END - DAY \\n WIDE ON: GANDALF’S CART pulls up outside the gate to BAG END ... \\na particularly fine example of a HOBBIT HOLE, with a large round \\nfront door set into a grassy hillside. There is a sign on the gate which reads: “NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON PARTY BUSINESS.”  \\n \\nGANDALF strides up the garden path of BAG END. He raises his staff and raps on the front door ... a voice calls out: \\n \\n     BILBO (O.S.) \\n  No thank you! We don't want any more  \\n  visitors, well-wishers, or distant    relations. \\n \\n     GANDALF   And what about very old friends? \\n \\nSuddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him. He is a HOBBIT OF INDETERMINATE AGE, with a mischeivous TWINKLE in \\nhis eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he look every \\ninch the eccentric gentleman. \\n \\n     BILBO   Gandalf? \\n \\n     GANDALF   Bilbo Baggins! \\n \\n     BILBO   My dear Gandalf! \\n \\nGANDALF drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.  \\n     GANDALF \\nGood to see you.

Did you see their  \\n  faces?  \\n     GANDALF \\nThere are many magic rings in this world, Bilbo Baggins, and none of them \\nshould be used lightly. \\n      BILBO \\n  It was just a bit of fun. Oh, you’re  \\n  probably right, as usual.    \\n \\n     BILBO   You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't  \\n  you? \\n       (CONTINUED) 28. \\n \\n CONTINUED:  \\n \\n     GANDALF   Two eyes.

Is that  \\n  staying too?  \\nCLOSE ON: BILBO ... he gives GANDALF a look and nods towards the \\nmantelpiece.  \\n     BILBO \\n  Yes, yes, it's in an envelope ... over   there on the mantelpiece. \\n \\nGANDALF frowns at the empty mantelpiece ... BILBO suddenly feels \\nhis waistcoat with a look of guilty surprise. \\n      BILBO (CONT’D) \\nNo, wait. It’s here in my pocket. Isn't \\nthat ... isn’t that odd, now? Yet, after all, why not? Why shouldn't I \\nkeep it? \\n      GANDALF \\n  I think you should leave the Ring  \\n  behind, Bilbo. Is that so hard? \\n \\n     BILBO \\nWell, no ... and yes. Now it comes to \\nit, I don't feel like parting with it. \\nIt’s mine. I found it. It came to me! \\n \\nANGLE ON: GANDALF LOOKS DOWN AT BILBO WITH RISING CONCERN. \\n      GANDALF \\n  There's no need to get angry. \\n      BILBO \\nWell, if I'm angry, it's your fault!  \\nIt's mine. My own, my precious. \\n \\n     GANDALF   Precious? It's been called that before,  \\n  but not by you. \\n       (CONTINUED) 29. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\n     BILBO   What business is it of yours what I do  \\n  with my own things? \\n \\nBILBO’S voice, shape and manner have suddenly changed. \\n      GANDALF \\n  I think you've had that ring quite  \\n  long enough.  \\n     BILBO \\n  You want it for yourself!  \\nGANDALF rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow \\nsuddenly seems to fill the room.  \\n     GANDALF \\n  Bilbo Baggins, do not take me for some  \\n  conjurer of cheap tricks!  \\n BILBO cowers from GANDALF, disarmed by his power ... a \\nfrightened HOBBIT. GANDALF’S expression softens. \\n      GANDALF (CONT’D) \\n  I am not trying to rob you. I am trying  \\n  to help you.   \\nSobbing, BILBO runs to GANDALF and hugs him. \\n \\n     GANDALF (CONT’D) \\nAll your long years we’ve been friends ... trust me as you once did. Let it \\ngo! \\n      BILBO \\nYou're right, Gandalf.

The spirit of Sauron endured. \\nHis life force is bound to the Ring and \\nthe Ring survived. Sauron has returned. \\nHis Orcs have multiplied ... his \\nfortress of Barad-dûr is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this \\nRing to cover all the lands in the \\nsecond darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it, all his thought is bent on \\nit. For the Ring yearns, above all else, \\nto return to the hand of its master: They are one, the Ring and the Dark \\nLord.

Their \\nhaunting song continues. \\n  ELVEN VOICES \\n (Elvish) \\n  a Galad ren i veniar    hi' aladhremmin ennorath  \\n  A Elbereth Gilthoniel  \\n  ithil nâ thûl, ithil lîn hen  \\n \\n  O Light to us that wander here    Amid the world of woven trees!  \\n  O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!  \\n  Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath!  \\nANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM watching the procession from behind a \\ntree.  \\n FRODO \\n  They're going to the harbour beyond   \\n  the White Towers. To the Grey Havens. \\n  SAM \\n  They're leaving Middle-earth. \\n  FRODO \\n  Never to return. \\n    SAM \\n I don't know why ... it makes me sad. \\n     CUT TO: \\n \\nEXT. HOBBITON WOODS - NIGHT \\n \\nFRODO appears asleep. SAM tries desperately to find a comfortable spot on the ground. \\n \\n    (CONTINUED) 48. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n   SAM  Everywhere I lie there’s a dirty \\n great root sticking into my back. \\n \\nFRODO neither moves nor opens his eyes. \\n    FRODO \\n Just shut your eyes, and imagine \\n you're back in your own bed, with a  soft mattress and a lovely feather \\n pillow. \\n ANGLE ON: SAM looks skeptical, but tries it.  \\n \\n   SAM   (sighs) \\n It's not working Mr. Frodo. I'm never \\n going to be able to sleep out here. \\n \\n   FRODO  Me neither, Sam. \\n \\nFRODO smiles. SAM stares at the sky and finds something to nibble on. \\n \\nEXT. SHIRE, A HILL - NIGHT  \\nWIDE ON: Mist descends over the peaceful Shire.  \\n \\nTRACK BACK TO REVEAL: A horse neighs and stamps. Its BLACK RIDER \\ncomes slowly to a halt and looks for his prey.  \\n CUT TO: \\n EXT. ISENGARD VALLEY - DAY \\n \\nGANDALF is galloping along the outskirts of the ancient forest of FANGORN. Nestled in a basin at the foot of the distant MISTY \\nMOUNTAINS, the tall black tower of ORTHANC is clearly visible. \\n EXT. ISENGARD VALLEY - DAY \\n \\nGANDALF gallops through the gate, into the fortress of ISENGARD \\n... a great ring-wall of stone, a mile from rim to rim, encloses \\nbeautiful trees and garden, watered by streams that flow down from the mountains. \\n \\n       (CONTINUED) 49. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n     SARUMAN (V.O.)   Smoke rises once more from the mountain  \\n  of doom ... the Shadow takes shape in  \\n  the darkness of Mordor; the hour grows  \\n  late ... and Gandalf the Grey rides to  \\n  Isengard seeking my council...  \\nThe strange tower of ORTHANC ... hewn from a solid pillar of \\nobsidian ... rises up in the center of the ISENGARD CIRCLE. GANDALF arrives at he foot of the ORTHANC STAIRS. \\n \\nANGLE ON: SARUMAN, THE WHITE WIZARD as he sweeps down the  ORTHANC stairs. \\n \\n     SARUMAN   For that is why you have come, is it  \\n  not, my old friend? \\n \\nGANDALF moves quickly towards him, grimy and weary from his long \\nride.  \\n     GANDALF \\n  Saruman!  \\n      CUT TO: \\n EXT. ISENGARD GARDENS - DAY \\n \\nGANDALF and SARUMAN walk slowly between the beautiful trees of \\nISENGARD. SARUMAN’S clean, white robe contrasts with GANDALF’S \\ndusty grey robes.  \\n     SARUMAN \\n  Are you sure of this?  \\n     GANDALF \\n  Beyond any doubt.  \\n     SARUMAN \\n  So the Ring of Power has been found?  \\n     GANDALF \\n  All these long years, it was in the  \\n  Shire, under my very nose. \\n      SARUMAN \\n  Yet you did not have the wit to see \\n  it. Your love of the Halfling’s leaf    has clearly slowed your mind. \\n      (CONTINUED) 50. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n     GANDALF   We still have time ... time enough to  \\n  counter Sauron ... if we act quickly. \\n \\n     SARUMAN \\n  Time? What time do you think we have?  \\n      CUT TO: \\n INT. ORTHANC ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY \\n \\nGANDALF and SARUMAN are seated in a small, cluttered room to the side of the cavernous central chamber. \\n \\n     SARUMAN   Sauron has regained much of his former  \\n  strength. He cannot yet take physical  \\n  form ... but his spirit has lost none of  \\n  its potency. Concealed within his  \\n  fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all.    His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth  \\n  and flesh. You know of what I speak,  \\n  Gandalf ... a Great Eye, lidless,     wreathed in flame. \\n \\n     GANDALF    (softly) \\n  The Eye of Sauron. \\n \\n     SARUMAN \\n  He is gathering all evil to him. Very    soon, he will have summoned an army  \\n  great enough to launch an assault on  \\n  Middle earth.  \\n     GANDALF \\n  You know this? How?  \\n     SARUMAN \\n  I have seen it.  \\nGANDALF and SARUMAN stride through ORTHANC toward a stone plinth \\non which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth... \\n \\n     GANDALF   A Palantír is a dangerous tool, Saruman. \\n \\nANGLE ON: SARUMAN lifts the cloth to reveal the PALANTÍR.  \\n      (CONTINUED) 51. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n     SARUMAN   Why? Why should we fear to use it? \\n \\n     GANDALF \\n  They are not all accounted for, the \\n  lost Seeing-stones. We do not know who    else may be watching. \\n \\nGANDALF throws the cloth back over the PALANTÍR.  \\nFLASH IMAGE: A FIERY EYE! \\n ANGLE ON: SARUMAN sits on his throne. \\n \\n     SARUMAN   The hour is later than you think.  \\n  Sauron’s forces are already moving... \\n  the Nine have left Minas Morgul. \\n \\n     GANDALF    (shocked) \\n  The Nine? \\n      SARUMAN \\n  They crossed the River Isen on  \\n  Midsummer's Eve, disguised as riders in    black. \\n \\n     GANDALF \\n   (alarmed) \\n  They have reached the Shire?  \\nSARUMAN shrugs... \\n      SARUMAN \\n  They will find the Ring ... and kill \\n  the one who carries it. \\n \\nGANDALF backs away and turns to run to the door ... horrified as \\nthe doors suddenly slam shut.  \\n     SARUMAN (CONT’D) \\n  You did not seriously think a Hobbit  \\n  could contend with the will of Sauron?  \\n  There are none who can.  \\nGANDALF slowly turns to SARUMAN ... a look of dawning horror. \\n       (CONTINUED) 52. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\n     SARUMAN (CONT’D)   Against the power of Mordor there can  \\n  be no victory. We must join with him,  \\n  Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It  \\n  would be wise, my friend. \\n      GANDALF \\n   (deadly) \\n  Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the    Wise abandon reason for madness? \\n \\nAT THAT MOMENT: GANDALF is suddenly blasted across the room! He slams againt the wall ... pinned there by some unseen force. \\n \\nWith sudden effort, GANDALF wrenches himself off the wall and swings his staff on SARUMAN ... blasting him off his feet! \\n \\nGANDALF and SARUMAN battle, powerful blasts throwing them across \\nthe room.  \\n SARUMAN SCREAMS, EYES BLAZING! GANDALF’S staff is suddenly \\nwrenched from his grasp ... it flies across the chamber into \\nSARUMAN’S hand! GANDALF is flung to the floor.  \\n     SARUMAN \\nI gave you the choice of aiding me willingly, but you have elected the way \\nof pain! \\n \\nGANDALF is breathing hard on the floor, his eye look into the \\nmadness of SARUMAN...  \\nCOMMANDING TWO STAFFS, SARUMAN sends GANDALF into a sickening \\nspin. GANDALF tumbles towards the top of the chamber ... as if falling in reverse. \\n \\nRUSHING POV: the roof of ORTHANC rockets toward CAMERA.  \\n      CUT TO: \\n EXT. FARMER’S FIELDS - DAY \\n \\nWIDE ON: FRODO and SAM walking along a country lane which \\nborders FARMER MAGGOT’S FIELDS.  \\n ANGLE ON: SAM is looking up ...

Mr. Frodo! \\n \\nFRODO turns, surprised as SAM comes running towards him. \\n      SAM (CONT’D) \\n   (worried) \\n  I thought I'd lost you.  \\nANGLE ON: FRODO looks at SAM suspiciously.  \\n ANGLE ON: SAM glances down, embarrassed. \\n \\n     FRODO    (teasing) \\n  What are you talking about? \\n \\n     SAM \\n   (mumbling)   It's just something Gandalf said... \\n \\n     FRODO   What did he say? \\n \\n     SAM   He said...“Don't you leave him,  \\n  Samwise Gamgee.”  \\n   (looks at Frodo intently) \\n  And I don't mean to. \\n      FRODO \\n   (laughing) \\n  Sam ... we're still in the Shire ...    what could possibly happen? \\n \\nSUDDENLY! A figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow sending FRODO flying. FRODO picks himself up, only to be knocked back \\ndown again by PIPPIN. \\n      PIPPIN \\n  Frodo! Merry, it's Frodo Baggins. \\n \\n     MERRY \\n  Hello Frodo!  \\nANGLE ON: MERRY, PIPPIN, and FRODO picking themselves up ... a \\nvariety of vegetables have scattered everywhere.  \\n      (CONTINUED) 54. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\n     SAM   What’s the meaning of this! \\n \\n     MERRY \\n  Sam, hold this... \\n MERRY gives SAM a large cabbage. \\n \\n     SAM   You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop! \\n \\nANGLE ON: A large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the HEDGEROW ... angry shouts from FARMER MAGGOT. \\n \\n  FARMER MAGGOT (O.S.)   Who’s that in my field! Get out of it!  \\n  Get out of my field, you young varmits!  \\n  I’ll show you ... get out of my corn. \\n \\nANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN hurriedly gather their booty and race away ... with FRODO and SAM on their heels. \\n \\n     MERRY   I don't know why he is so upset, it's  \\n  only a couple of carrots. \\n      PIPPIN \\nAnd some cabbages ... and those three  \\nbags of potatoes that we lifted last  \\nweek. And the mushrooms the week  \\nbefore.  \\n   MERRY \\nYes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly overreacting. \\n \\nON THE SOUNDTRACK: The BAYING OF LARGE DOG sounds!  \\n     PIPPIN \\n  Run!  \\n      CUT TO: \\n \\nEXT. WOODED ROAD - DAY \\n FRODO, SAM, and MERRY and PIPPIN tumble head over heel down a \\nbank, onto a dark, wooded road. \\n       (CONTINUED) 55. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nCLOSE ON: A winded PIPPIN, his face inches away from a large pile of HORSE droppings... \\n \\n     PIPPIN \\n  That was close. \\n FRODO picks himself up and looks around quickly. \\n \\n     MERRY    (groaning) \\n  Ow ... I think I've broken something. \\n He PULLS a LARGE CARROT, almost broken through in the middle, \\nout from his back pocket. \\n      MERRY (CONT’D) \\n  Oh. \\n \\n     SAM \\n   (turning on Merry and Pippin)   Trust a Brandybuck and a Took! \\n \\n     MERRY   What? That was just a detour ... \\n  a short cut. \\n      SAM \\n  A shortcut to what? \\n \\nPIPPIN has spied something under the trees on the far side of \\nthe road.  \\n     PIPPIN \\n   (excited)   Mushrooms! \\n \\nCLOSE ON: SMALL, brown mushrooms growing amongst the LOAMY undergrowth. SAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN race toward the mushrooms! \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO is tense and watchful. He realizes they are on a wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air WHIRLING down \\nthe road as if blown by an invisible wind... \\n \\nSUDDENLY ... THE SOUND OF HORSE HOOVES... \\n      FRODO \\n  I think we should get off the road. \\n       (CONTINUED) 56. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\nA long drawn WAIL comes down the wind, like the cry of some evil and lovely creature. \\n \\n     FRODO (CONT’D) \\n   (more urgency) \\n  Get off the road!  \\nSAM grabs MERRY and PIPPIN as the HOBBITS quickly scramble down \\nthe bank, hiding under a mossy log.  \\nTHE SOUND OF HOOVES is close ... a sinister MOUNTED RINGWRAITH \\nsteps into view ... hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black horse with insane eyes!  \\n \\nFRODO freezes in terror.  \\nANGLE ON: The RINGWRAITH pauses right beside their hiding place \\n... he sits very still with head bowed, listening. From inside \\nthe hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an \\nelusive scent: he head turning from side to side.  \\nCLOSE ON: FRODO ... beads of sweat gather on his brow \\n ANGLE ON: The RINGWRAITH suddenly slides off his horse, leaning \\nover the mossy log, peering suspiciously into the woods. \\n CLOSE ON: FRODO ... he is drawing the RING out of his pocket, \\nwith trembling hands ... his face fevered and sweating as if in \\nthe grip of some terrible INTERNAL STRUGGLE.  \\n \\nThe SOUND OF SNIFFING intensifies as the RINGWRAITH darts his head from side to side like a bird of prey. \\n \\nCLOSE ON: FRODO SQUEEZING HIS EYES SHUT...  \\nQUICK PSYCHIC BLASTS! AN EVIL DARK TOWER ... A GREAT EYE ... A \\nBURST OF FLAME.  \\nANGLE ON: SAM LOOKING AT FRODO WITH CONCERN. \\n      SAM \\n  Frodo? \\n \\nMERRY desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road ... the \\nRINGWRAITH spins around at the sound, and darts to the far side of the road with frightening speed. \\n \\n       (CONTINUED) 57. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (3) \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO instantly slumps ... as if a PSYCHIC LINK had been broken... \\n \\n     MERRY \\n  What was that? \\n FRODO is staring, a look of shock on his face at the RING lying \\nin the palm of his hand. \\n EXT. FERRY LANE - NIGHT \\n \\nFRODO, SAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN hurry through the trees ... slipping and sliding on the muddy ground. \\n \\n     SAM   Anything? \\n \\n     FRODO \\n  Nothing. \\n      PIPPIN \\n  What is going on? \\n ANGLE ON: MERRY moves past PIPPIN, toward FRODO, watching \\nintently ...

Four Hobbits, and what’s more,   out of the Shire by your talk. What  \\n  business brings you to Bree? \\n      FRODO \\n  We wish to stay at the inn ... our  \\n  business is our own. \\n \\nTo FRODO’S relief, OLD HARRY unlocks the gate.  \\n     OLD HARRY \\n  All right, young sir, I meant no    offense.  \\n      (CONTINUED) 60. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nThe HOBBITS gratefully enter BREE ..

ORTHANC SUMMIT - NIGHT   \\nSARUMAN stands over GANDALF, gloating... \\n \\n     SARUMAN \\n  A friendship with Saruman is not    lightly thrown aside.  \\n \\nWith the power of his staff, SARUMAN tosses GANDALF from one side of ORTHANC to off the edge of the other side where he holds \\nGANDALF, suspended ... as if GANDALF is standing on the side of \\nthe tower.   \\n     SARUMAN \\n  One ill turn deserves another. It is  \\n  over. Embrace the power of the Ring  \\n  or embrace your own destruction!  \\nSARUMAN raises GANDALF again, then sends him crashing to the \\nfloor.   \\n     GANDALF \\n  There is only one Lord of the Ring.    Only one who can bend it to his will  \\n  ... and he does not share power. \\n SUDDENLY! GANDALF lurches to his feet and THROWS himself off the \\nTOWER! SARUMAN watches GANDALF fly away from ISENGARD ... on the \\nBACK of a GIANT EAGLE. \\n \\n     SARUMAN    (chilling) \\n  So you have chosen death. \\n       CUT TO: \\n 86. \\n \\n EXT.

FRODO’S BEDROOM, RIVENDELL - DAY  \\nFRODO raises himself up and looks at GANDALF. \\n      FRODO \\n  Gandalf! What is it? \\n GANDALF returns his attention to FRODO. \\n \\n     GANDALF   Nothing, Frodo... \\n \\nANGLE ON: SAM runs to FRODO’S bedside. He is overjoyed to find \\nFRODO awake. \\n      SAM \\n  Frodo! Frodo! Bless you, you’re awake!! \\n      GANDALF \\n  Sam has hardly left your side. \\n      SAM \\n  We were worried about you -- weren't we,  \\n  Mr. Gandalf? \\n \\n     GANDALF   By the skills of Lord Elrond, you’re \\n  beginning to mend. \\n ANGLE ON: ELROND, LORD OF THE HIGH ELVES, steps up to FRODO’S \\nbedside .. his face is neither old nor young, though in it is \\nwritten the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful.  \\n     ELROND \\n  Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.  \\nFRODO sits up, looking at ELROND with awe. \\n \\n      CUT TO: \\n 87. \\n \\n EXT. RIVENDELL VALLEY - DAY \\n \\nWIDE ON: RIVENDELL ... a small cluster of elegant ELVEN BUILDINGS sitting in a Shangri-la like VALLEY below towering \\ncliffs and snow capped mountains. \\n \\n     ELROND (V.O.) \\n  You have found your way to the last    homely house east of the sea. The Elves  \\n  of Imladris have dwelt within this  \\n  valley for 3,000 years though few of my    kin now remain. \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO looks out from his balcony.  \\n      CUT TO: \\n EXT. RIVENDELL GARDENS - DAY \\n \\nFRODO and SAM walk together. Suddenly, the voices of MERRY and \\nPIPPIN can be heard as they bound up to FRODO and throw their \\narms around him.  \\n     MERRY  \\n  Frodo! Frodo!  \\nSAM looks past FRODO smiling ... a bent figure sits alone on a \\nbench, in the SUN.   \\nCLOSE ON: FRODO turning, following SAM’S gaze... \\n \\n     FRODO \\n  Bilbo!  \\nEXT. RIVENDELL TERRACE - DAY \\n CLOSE ON: BILBO BAGGINS! He breaks into a broad grin as FRODO \\nrushes forward to embrace him. BILBO has aged significantly \\nsince we last saw him.  \\n     BILBO \\n  Hello, Frodo, my lad!  \\n     FRODO \\n  Bilbo! \\n \\nLATER ... FRODO is turning the neatly inscribed title page of a red leather bound journal: \\n \\n       (CONTINUED) 88. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n     FRODO (CONT’D)   “There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale”  \\n  by Bilbo Baggins. \\n \\nBILBO smiles PROUDLY. He is sitting with FRODO on a terrace \\noverlooking a WATERFALL. FRODO looks at PAGE AFTER PAGE of beautiful HANDWRITING, with intricate MAPS and DRAWINGS. \\n \\n     FRODO (CONT’D)   This is wonderful. \\n \\n     BILBO \\nI meant to go back ... wander the paths \\nof Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the \\nLonely Mountain again ... but age, it seems, has finally caught up with me. \\n \\nFRODO turns a page ... there before him, is a map of the SHIRE. \\n \\n   FRODO  (quietly) \\nI miss the Shire ... I spent all \\nmy childhood pretending I was off somewhere else ... off with you, \\non one of your adventures...  \\n (looks at Bilbo) But my own adventure turned out to \\nbe quite different ...

It’s just... We did what  Gandalf wanted, didn't we? We got the \\nRing this far, to Rivendell ... and I \\nthought ... seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon. Off home. \\n \\n   FRODO You're right, Sam... \\n \\nFRODO looks at SAM... \\n \\n   FRODO (CONT’D) ...we did what we set out to do.  \\n \\nCLOSE ON: FRODO opens his hand, the RING sits in his PALM. \\n \\n   FRODO (CONT’D) \\nThe Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

He  \\n  will carry it the rest of his life. \\n \\n     ELROND \\n  Yet to have come so far still bearing    the Ring ... the Hobbit has shown  \\n  extraordinary resilience to its evil. \\n      GANDALF \\n  It is a burden he should never have \\n  had to bear. We can ask no more of \\n  Frodo. \\n \\n     ELROND   Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's  \\n  forces are massing in the East. His Eye  \\n  is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you  \\n  tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of  \\n  allies grows thin.  \\n     GANDALF \\n  His treachery runs deeper than you    know. By foul craft, Saruman has  \\n  crossed Orcs with Goblin Men ... He’s  \\n  breeding an army in the caverns of    Isengard. An army that can move in  \\n  Sunlight and cover great distance at  \\n  speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring. \\n \\nELROND turns and walks away...  \\n     ELROND \\n  This evil cannot be concealed by the    power of the Elves... We do not have  \\n  the strength to fight both Mordor and  \\n  Isengard ... Gandalf ... the Ring   cannot stay here. \\n \\nGANDALF turns and looks out the window.  \\nANGLES ON: Sounds of arrivals ... GANDALF watches as BOROMIR \\nrides through the RIVENDELL gate, followed by LEGOLAS and GIMLI. \\n \\n     ELROND (V.O.) (CONT’D)   This peril belongs to all Middle-Earth.  \\n  They must decide now how to end it.  \\n       (CONTINUED) 91. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\nANGLE ON: ELROND approaches GANDALF.  \\n     ELROND (V.O.) (CONT’D) \\n  The time of the Elves is over. My  \\n  people are leaving these shores. Who  \\n  will you look to when we’ve gone? The    Dwarves? They hide in their mountains  \\n  seeking riches. They care nothing for  \\n  the troubles of others.  \\n     GANDALF \\n  It is in Men that we must place our   hope. \\n \\n     ELROND   Men? Men are weak. The race of Men is  \\n  failing. The blood of Númenor is all  \\n  but spent, its pride and dignity  \\n  forgotten. It is because of Men the  \\n  Ring survives.   \\nFLASH INSERT: With the broken sword, ISILDUR slices off SAURON’S \\nfinger. ELROND reacts.  \\n     ELROND (V.O.) (CONT’D) \\n  I was there, Gandalf.

ELROND’S CHAMBER, RIVENDELL - DAY \\n \\nANGLE ON: ELROND turns to GANDALF. \\n      ELROND \\n  It should have ended that day, but evil  \\n  was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the    Ring ... and the line of kings was  \\n  broken. There’s no strength left in the  \\n  world of Men. They are scattered,    divided, leaderless. \\n \\n     GANDALF \\n  There is one who could unite them, one  \\n  who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.   \\n     ELROND \\n  He turned from that path a long time    ago. He has chosen exile. \\n \\n      CUT TO:  \\nINT. ELROND’S CHAMBER, RIVENDELL - NIGHT \\n ANGLE ON: STRIDER watches from the shadows ... as BOROMIR  \\nstrolls through the darkened gallery. BOROMIR’S eyes are drawn  \\nto an old FRESCO on the wall ... depicting ISILDUR defeating \\nSAURON. \\n BOROMIR turns suddenly and notices STRIDER, looking at him. He \\nlooks STRIDER up and down, confused for a moment. \\n       (CONTINUED) 93. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n     BOROMIR   You are no Elf. \\n \\n     STRIDER \\n  Men of the South are welcome here. \\n      BOROMIR \\n  Who are you? \\n      STRIDER \\n  I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey. \\n BOROMIR nods, understanding Strider’s vagueness. \\n \\n     BOROMIR   Then we are here on common purpose ...  \\n  friend. \\n \\nBOROMIR smiles uncomfortably. STRIDER only looks at him \\nsilently.  \\nBOROMIR looks with WONDERMENT at NARSIL, the BROKEN BLADE of \\nELENDIL, which lies on a cloth-covered plinth.  \\n     BOROMIR (CONT’D) \\n   (quiet awe)   The shards of Narsil ... the blade that  \\n  cut the Ring from Sauron's hand. \\n \\nBOROMIR picks up the sword and gently touches the blade. \\n CLOSE ON: a small bloom of blood appears on BOROMIR’S  \\nfinger... \\n      BOROMIR (CONT’D) \\n  Still sharp.  \\n He slowly looks over to STRIDER, as if sensing a connection.  \\n \\n     BOROMIR (CONT’D)   But no more than a broken heirloom. \\n \\nBOROMIR replaces the blade, but it clatters to the floor.  \\nBOROMIR walks away, leaving STRIDER sitting alone. \\n CLOSE ON: STRIDER picks up the broken hilt, as ARWEN appears \\nbehind him. \\n  \\n      (CONTINUED) 94. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\n     ARWEN   Why do you fear the past? You are    \\n  Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself.  \\n  You are not bound to his fate. \\n \\n     STRIDER   The same blood flows in my veins ... \\n  the same weakness... \\n      ARWEN \\n  Your time will come.

I would rather  \\n  share one lifetime with you than face  \\n  all the Ages of this world alone.  \\n \\nCLOSE ON: STRIDER looks down. In his hand lies the EVENSTAR.   \\n     ARWEN (CONT’D) \\n  I choose a mortal life.  \\n     STRIDER \\n  You cannot give me this.  \\n     ARWEN \\n  It is mine to give to whom I will,    like my heart. \\n \\nARWEN closes STRIDER’S fingers around the jewel. \\n \\nARWEN leans towards STRIDER, gently kissing him.  96. \\n \\n INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER, RIVENDELL - DAY \\n \\nIMAGES from the PROLOGUE: the RINGS being given to the ELVES, DWARVES, and MEN. \\n \\n     ELROND (V.O.) \\nThree Rings for the Elven-kings \\nunder the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their \\nhalls of stone, \\nNine for Mortal Men doomed to die, One for the Dark Lord on his dark \\nthrone \\nIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. \\nOne Ring to rule them all. One \\nRing to find them,  One Ring to bring them all \\ntogether and in the darkness bind \\nthem, \\n  In the Land of Mordor where the \\n  Shadows lie.  \\n \\nCLOSE ON: FRODO opens his hand ... the RING lies in his palm. He \\nlooks up.  \\nANGLE ON: ELROND addresses the COUNCIL... \\n      ELROND \\n  Strangers from distant lands ...  \\n  friends of old. You have been summoned  \\n  here to answer the threat of Mordor.  \\n  Middle-Earth stands upon the brink of    destruction. None can escape it.  You  \\n  will unite ... or you will fall. Each  \\n  race is bound to this fate ... this one    doom... \\n \\nFRODO sits amongst a council of FREE-PEOPLES of Middle earth, ELROND stands before them, addressing GANDALF, STRIDER, LEGOLAS, \\nand 20 other ELVES, DWARVES, and MEN. \\n      ELROND (CONT’D) \\n  Bring forth the Ring, Frodo. \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO steps forward and moves towards a stone PLINTH. \\nHe places the RING on the plinth and returns to his seat.  \\n     BOROMIR \\n   (shocked)   So it is true! \\n \\n      (CONTINUED) 97. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n     LEGOLAS     (disbelief) \\n  Sauron’s Ring! The Ring of Power! \\n \\n     GIMLI \\n   (grim)   The doom of man! \\n \\nON THE SOUNDTRACK: The HUM of the RING sounds.   \\nANGLE ON: Several members of the COUNCIL take notice. BOROMIR \\nstands and begins to approach the RING, as if drawn to it.  \\n     BOROMIR \\n  In a dream, I saw the eastern sky grow    dark, but in the West a pale light  \\n  lingered. A voice was crying: “Your  \\n  doom is near at hand. Isildur’s Bane is  \\n  found.” \\n ANGLE ON: ELROND and GANDALF exchange glances. BOROMIR reaches \\nfor the RING. \\n      BOROMIR \\n  Isildur’s Bane. \\n      ELROND \\n   (standing) \\n  Boromir! \\n \\nANGLE ON: GANDALF stands and speaks in the BLACK TONGUE.   \\nON THE SOUNDTRACK: The RING responds to GANDALF.  \\n ANGLES ON: BOROMIR staggers back to his chair ... the sky \\ndarkens ... thunder rolls ... the ground trembles... \\n       GANDALF \\n (Black Speech) \\n  Ash nazg durbatulûk,    ash nazg gimbatul,  \\n  ash nazg thrakatulûk  \\n  agh burzum-ishi krimpatul. \\n \\n  One Ring to rule them all,    One Ring to find them,  \\n  One Ring to bring them all  \\n  and in the Darkness bind them.  \\n       (CONTINUED) 98. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\nNature returns to normal. ELROND looks to GANDALF.  \\n      ELROND \\n   (sternly) \\n  Never before has any voice uttered the  \\n  words of that tongue here in Imladris.  \\n      GANDALF \\n  I do not ask your pardon, Master     Elrond, for the Black Speech of Mordor  \\n  may yet be heard in every corner of the  \\n  West! The Ring is altogether evil.   \\nANGLE ON: GANDALF returns to his seat.  \\n ANGLE ON: BOROMIR shakes his head. He stands again to make his \\ncase to the COUNCIL. \\n \\n     BOROMIR \\n  It is a gift ... a gift to the foes of    Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has  \\n  my father, the Steward of Gondor, kept  \\n  the forces of Mordor at bay ... by the    blood of our people are your lands kept  \\n  safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the  \\n  enemy ... let us use it against him!  \\n     STRIDER \\n  You cannot wield it. None of us can.  \\n  The One Ring answers to Sauron alone  \\n  ... it has no other master.   \\nANGLE ON: BOROMIR turns and looks at STRIDER, coolly. \\n      BOROMIR \\n  And what would a Ranger know of this  \\n  matter?  \\nSTRIDER says nothing and BOROMIR turns away dismissively. \\n ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS stands... \\n \\n     LEGOLAS \\n  This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn,  \\n  son of Arathorn. You owe him your    allegiance.  \\n \\n       (CONTINUED) 99. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (3) \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO looks at STRIDER questioningly ... BOROMIR turns sharply. \\n \\n     BOROMIR \\n   (quiet disbelief) \\n  Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?  \\n     LEGOLAS \\n  And heir to the throne of Gondor.  \\n    STRIDER \\n   (Elvish: with subtitles)   Havo dad, Legolas... \\n \\n  Sit down, Legolas...  \\n     BOROMIR \\n  Gondor has no king.  \\n \\n     GANDALF   Aragorn is right ... we cannot use it. \\n \\n     ELROND   You have only one choice ... the Ring \\n  must be destroyed. \\n ON THE SOUNDTRACK: The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in \\nFRODO’S ears.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: GIMLI suddenly stands, excited. \\n      GIMLI \\n  Then ... what are we waiting for? \\n GIMLI suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the \\nRING. The axe SHATTERS with a deafening CRACK! GIMLI falls \\nbackwards staring in disbelief at the RING ... unharmed!  \\nANGLE ON: FRODO winces as an angry IMAGE of the FIERY EYE hits \\nhim! He slumps in his chair, clutching his forehead. GANDALF looks at him with concern. \\n \\n     ELROND \\n  The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,  \\n  son of Glóin, by any craft that we here    possess. The Ring was made in the fires  \\n  of Mount Doom ... only there can it be  \\n  unmade.       (MORE) \\n      (CONTINUED) 100. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (4) \\n \\n     ELROND (CONT’D)   It must be taken deep into Mordor, and  \\n  cast back into the fiery chasm from  \\n  whence it came. One of you must do  \\n  this. \\n STUNNED SILENCE ... the council sits with downcast eyes, as if a \\ngreat dread has descended upon them. \\n BOROMIR addresses the council in a quiet voice. \\n \\n     BOROMIR   One does not simply walk into Mordor.  \\n  Its Black Gates are guarded by more  \\n  than just Orcs. There is evil there    that does not sleep and the Great Eye  \\n  is ever watchful. It is a barren  \\n  wasteland riddled with fire, and ash  \\n  and dust ... the very air you breathe  \\n  is a poisonous fume. Not with ten    thousand Men could you do this. It is  \\n  folly. \\n      LEGOLAS \\n  Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has  \\n  said? The Ring must be destroyed.  \\n     GIMLI \\n  And I suppose you think you're the \\n  one to do it? \\n      BOROMIR \\n  And what if we fail, what then? What  \\n  happens when Sauron takes back what is    his? \\n \\nGIMLI leaps to his feet!  \\n     GIMLI \\n  I will be dead before I see the Ring in    the hands of an Elf!  \\n \\nA STORM OF ARGUMENT erupts around the room.  \\n \\nCLOSE ON: FRODO ... sound disappears as he watches in SLOW MOTION ... the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory \\nfingers, his eyes move to the RING ... THE HUM grows louder in \\nhis head.  \\n      (CONTINUED) 101. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (5) \\n \\n     GIMLI (CONT’D)    (shouting) \\n  Never trust an Elf! \\n \\nCLOSE ON: THE RING fills the screen ... streams of blood flow \\nacross the surface ... flames flicker within the GOLD BAND.  \\n     GANDALF \\n  Do you not understand? While we bicker    amongst ourselves, Sauron’s power  \\n  grows! No one will escape it. You will  \\n  all be destroyed, with your homes burnt    and your families put to the sword! \\n \\nCLOSE ON: FRODO ... breathing rapidly, CAUGHT in the grip of his hideous vision. With a huge effort of will, FRODO tears his gaze \\nupon the RING.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO suddenly stands ... he speaks in a strong, clear \\nvoice.  \\n     FRODO \\n  I will take it ... I will take it ...    I will take the Ring to Mordor.  \\n \\nSUDDEN SILENCE ... FRODO looks around the room at the astonished faces. \\n \\n     FRODO (CONT’D) \\n   (quietly) \\n  Though I do not know the way.  \\nANGLE ON: GANDALF rises to his feet. \\n      GANDALF \\n  I will help you bear this burden, Frodo  \\n  Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.  \\n     ARAGORN \\n  If by my life or death I can protect    you, I will. \\n   (kneels before Frodo) \\n  ...you have my sword. \\n \\nARAGORN steps forward ... followed by LEGOLAS and GIMLI.  \\n     LEGOLAS \\n  And you have my bow.  \\n      (CONTINUED) 102. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (6) \\n \\n     GIMLI   And my axe.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: BOROMIR looks at them all and then walks to FRODO. \\n \\n     BOROMIR   You carry the fates of us all, little  \\n  one.  \\n BOROMIR looks towards ELROND and GANDALF. \\n \\n     BOROMIR (CONT’D)   If this is indeed the will of the  \\n  Council, then Gondor will see it done.  \\n ANGLE ON: FRODO stares in wonder as the GREATEST FIGHTERS in all \\nMiddle earth stand at his side. \\n \\n     SAM \\n   (unseen)   Here! \\n \\nA SUDDEN NOISE ... SAM pops up from behind a BUSH!  \\n     SAM \\n  Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me.  \\n     ELROND \\n  No, indeed ... it is hardly possible to  \\n  separate you ... even when he is  \\n  summoned to a secret Council and you    are not.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN jump up from behind another bush!  \\n     MERRY \\n  Oi! We're coming too! You'd have to    send us home tied up in a sack to stop \\n  us. \\n      PIPPIN \\n  Anyway ... you need people of intelligence  \\n  on this sort of mission ... quest ...  \\n  thing... \\n      MERRY \\n  Well, that rules you out, Pip. \\n       (CONTINUED) 103. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (7) \\n \\nELROND SURVEYS THE GROUP.  \\n     ELROND \\n   (thoughtfully) \\n  Nine companions ... so be it.  \\n   (announcing)   You shall be the FELLOWSHIP OF THE \\n  RING. \\n      PIPPIN \\n  Great.

GILRAEN’S MEMORIAL, RIVENDELL - DAWN  \\nCLOSE ON: A HAND gently and reverently removes debris from the \\nbase and form of a STATUE \\n \\nANGLE ON: The STATUE OF GILRAEN’S hands are folded before her, and her head is hooded.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN stands back and gazes into her sad face.  \\n     ELROND (O.S.) \\n (Elvish; with subtitles)   Anirne hene beriad i chên în. Ned  \\n  Imladris nauthant e le beriathar  \\n  aen.  \\n \\n  She wanted to protect her child.    She thought that in Rivendell you  \\n  would be safe. \\n ANGLE ON: ELROND approaches ARAGORN. \\n \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN pays little attention to ELROND. He caresses the face of his MOTHER’S STATUE.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: ELROND approaches from behind ARAGORN.  \\n     ELROND \\n  In her heart, your mother knew you’d be \\n  hunted all your life. That you’d never  \\n  escape your fate. The skill of the    Elves can reforge the sword of kings,  \\n  but only you have the power to wield  \\n  it.    \\n      (CONTINUED) 104. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nCLOSE ON: ARAGORN TURNS to him.  \\n     ARAGORN \\n  I do not want that power. I have never \\n  wanted it. \\n      ELROND \\n  You are the last of that bloodline. \\n  There is no other. \\n \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN stands silently and continues looking upon the \\nSTATUE.  \\nINT. FRODO’S BEDROOM, RIVENDELL - DAWN \\n CLOSE ON: AN OLD SWORD sliding out of a shabby leather \\nSCABBARD... Its polished, well tendered BLADE glitters COLD AND \\nBRIGHT. \\n     BILBO \\n  My old sword “Sting” ... here, take it!   \\nBILBO offers STING to FRODO. \\n      FRODO \\n  It's so light! \\n      BILBO \\n  Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know. \\n  The blade glows blue when Orcs are \\n  close ... and it’s times like that, \\n  my lad, when you have to be extra \\n  careful. \\n \\nBILBO unwraps a SMALL SHIRT OF CLOSE WOVEN MAIL.  \\n     BILBO \\n  Here’s a pretty thing. Mithril, as light    as a feather, and as hard as dragon  \\n  scales. Let me see you put it on. Come  \\n  on.  \\nCLOSE ON: FRODO peels off his SHIRT ... revealing the RING on \\nthe CHAIN around his neck. \\n \\n     BILBO (CONT’D)    (entranced) \\n  Oh! My old Ring...  \\n  \\n      (CONTINUED) 105. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nFRODO frowns as BILBO moves toward him.  \\n     BILBO (CONT’D) \\n  I should very much like to hold it again,  \\n  one last time. \\n BILBO reaches forward, eyes locked on the RING. \\n \\nANGLE ON: SUDDENLY! A SHADOW passes across BILBO ... for a split second he becomes a WRINKLED CREATURE with a HUNGRY FACE and \\nBONY, GROPING HANDS.  \\n ANGLE ON: FRODO pulls away, shocked... \\n \\nANGLE ON: THE SHADOW passes... BILBO slumps into a chair, his head in his hands. BILBO falters ... his eyes filling with \\ntears. \\n \\n     BILBO (CONT’D) \\n  Oh!    (sad) \\n  I'm sorry, that I brought this upon  \\n  you, my boy. I'm sorry that you must   carry this burden. I'm sorry for \\n  everything. \\n BILBO sobs and FRODO moves to comfort him. \\n \\n      CUT TO: \\n \\nEXT. RIVENDELL TERRACE - DAY  \\nANGLE ON: ELROND and FRODO walk towards the rest of the \\nFELLOWSHIP waiting at the Gate of RIVENDELL.  \\n     ELROND \\n  The time has come for the Ring to set    out. You cannot count on your journey  \\n  being aided by war or force. You will  \\n  pass into the domain of the Enemy far    from aid. Do you still hold to your  \\n  word Frodo, that you will be the \\n  Ring-bearer? \\n \\n     FRODO   I do. I must. I will go with Sam. \\n \\n       (CONTINUED) 106. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n     ELROND   Then I cannot help you much, not even  \\n  with counsel. I can foresee very little \\n  of your road; and how your task is to   be achieve\\n  Mountains, and draws nigh even to the  \\n  borders of  the Greyflood; and under the  \\n  Shadow all is dark to me. You will meet  \\n  many foes, some open, and some  \\n  disguised; and you may find friends    upon your way when you least look for   \\n  it. I will send out messages, such as I  \\n  can contrive, to those whom I know in    the wide world; but so perilous have  \\n  the lands now become that some may well  \\n  miscarry, or come no quicker than you   yourself. Had I a host of Elves in  \\n  armor of the Elder Days, it would  \\n  avail little, save to arouse the  \\n  power of Mordor. Are you confident  \\n  in your companions?  \\n     FRODO \\n  Yes, Lord Elrond. I must be, I’m    afraid, for if I doubt them, we may  \\n  never succeed. \\n      ELROND \\n  And what of your Hobbit friends? I had  \\n  hoped to send them back to the Shire as  \\n  messengers to warn the people of the  \\n  impending danger according to the    fashion of your country. I feel that  \\n  the youngest, Peregrin Took, should not  \\n  go with you. My heart is against it.   \\n     FRODO \\n  His heart is set upon going. There will    be no stopping him, even if you did  \\n  send him home in a sack. \\n      ELROND \\n  Let it be so then. The Fellowship awaits. \\n \\nWIDE ON: ELROND and FRODO turn a corner and descend to the \\nFELLOWSHIP, now waiting by the gate.  107. \\n \\n EXT. RIVENDELL GATE - DAY \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO joins the FELLOWSHIP, ready to depart. They are set to go on foot with only SAM’S PONY, BILL, to carry much of \\ntheir baggage. \\n \\nANGLE ON: ELROND stands with the ELVES, addressing their only \\nhope of success.  \\n     ELROND \\n  The Ring-bearer is setting out on    the Quest of Mount Doom. On you who  \\n  travel with him, no oath nor bond is  \\n  laid to go further that you will.    Farewell. Hold to your purpose. May  \\n  the blessing of Elves and Men and all  \\n  Free Folk go with you.  \\n     GANDALF \\n  The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO slowly turns to the FELLOWSHIP and timidly makes his way to the head of the GROUP.  \\n \\nFRODO’S POV: The faces of those who vowed to follow him watch as he makes his way to lead the FELLOWSHIP. \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO leads the FELLOWSHIP out of RIVENDELL. He turns to GANDALF. \\n \\n     FRODO \\n  Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or  \\n  right?  \\nANGLE ON: GANDALF continues looking ahead. \\n      GANDALF \\n  Left. \\n ANGLE ON: GANDALF places his hand on Frodo’s left shoulder. The \\nFELLOWSHIP follows FRODO into the Middle-Earth. \\n ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to bid a silent farewell. \\n \\nANGLE ON: ARWEN stands in a group of ELVES, watching him.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: He nods to her and follows the FELLOWSHIP out.  108. \\n \\n EXT. RIVENDELL VALLEY - MORNING \\n \\nANGLE ON: The FELLOWSHIP climbs the long steep path out of the cloven vale of RIVENDELL. \\n \\n      CUT TO: \\n \\nEXT. ROUGH COUNTRY, SOUTH OF RIVENDELL - DAY  \\nANGLE ON: The FELLOWSHIP trekking through a land of DEEP VALLEYS \\nand turbulent water ... The MISTY MOUNTAINS rise sharply to their left. \\n \\n     GANDALF (V.O.)   We must hold to this course, west of  \\n  the Misty Mountains, for forty days. If  \\n  our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will    still be open to us. From there, our   \\n  road turns east, to Mordor. \\n \\n      CUT TO: \\n EXT. EREGION HILLS - DAWN \\n \\nCLOSE ON: SAM at the CAMPFIRE.

I want \\n  you to react, not think. \\n      SAM \\n  Should not be too hard... \\n      BOROMIR \\n  Move your feet. \\n      MERRY \\n  Quite good, Pippin. \\n      PIPPIN \\n  Thanks. \\n \\nCLOSE ON: GIMLI has managed to corner GANDALF... \\n  \\n      (CONTINUED) 109. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n     GIMLI   If anyone were to ask for my opinion, \\n  which I note they have not, I would say  \\n  we are taking the long way round.  \\n  Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines   \\n  of Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give    us a royal  welcome. \\n \\nANGLE ON: GANDALF clearly thinks this is a bad idea.  \\n     GANDALF \\n  No, Gimli. I would not take the road   through Moria unless I had no other \\n  choice. \\n ANGLE ON: BOROMIR thrusts, catching PIPPIN on the hand. PIPPIN \\nthrows down his SWORD, KICKS and LUNGES at BOROMIR, tackling him \\no the ground. Much laughter. \\n \\nANGLE ON: LEGOLAS’ EYES are fixed on a DISTANT DARK PATCH which darts about in the sky, like flying smoke in the wind. \\n \\n     SAM   What is that? \\n \\n     GIMLI   Nothing ... it’s just a wisp of cloud. \\n \\n     BOROMIR \\n   (worried) \\n  It's moving fast ... against the wind.  \\n     LEGOLAS \\n  Crebain from Dunland!        \\n     ARAGORN \\n   (urgently)   Hide! \\n \\n     BOROMIR   Merry ... Pippin ... Sam ... take cover! \\n \\nWIDE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP scramble under what little cover there \\nis ... as a regiment of LARGE CROWS fly overhead at GREAT SPEED, \\nwheeling and circling above. As their dark shadow passes over the FELLOWSHIP a single harsh CROAK is heard...and the CROWS \\nsuddenly wheel away, back towards the SOUTH.  \\n       (CONTINUED) 110. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\nANGLE ON: GANDALF staggers to his feet.  \\n     GANDALF \\n  Spies of Saruman. The passage south is  \\n  being watched.  \\n GANDALF looks at ARAGORN, turns to the others...gestures towards \\na high mountain pass. \\n      GANDALF (CONT’D) \\n  We must take the Pass of Caradhras! \\n       CUT TO: \\n \\nEXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY  \\nANGLE ON: The FELLOWSHIP clamber through ROCK and SNOW.  \\n \\nCLOSE ON: FRODO slips on some SHALE ... as he scrambles to his \\nfeet, the RING falls on the ground.  \\nCLOSE ON: The RING gleaming in the snow! BOROMIR’S HAND picks it \\nup by the CHAIN.  \\nANGLE ON: He stands, the RING dangling before his eyes. He seems \\nto grow in stature, as if absorbing its power.   \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN warily approaches BOROMIR. \\n \\nANGLE ON: BOROMIR is motionless ... he stares at the RING, as if \\ntransfixed.  \\n     ARAGORN \\n  Boromir?  \\n     BOROMIR \\n  It is a strange fate that we should   suffer so much fear and doubt over \\n  so small a thing ... such a little \\n  thing. \\n \\n     ARAGORN \\n   (quietly) \\n  Boromir ... give the Ring to Frodo. \\n CLOSE ON: ARAGORN’S HAND moves to his sword hilt. \\n \\nRING’S POV: Looking at BOROMIR’S face.  \\n      (CONTINUED) 111. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nON THE SOUNDTRACK: The strange HUM VIBRATES.  \\nCLOSE ON: A WEIRD BEATIFIC SMILE lights up on BOROMIR’S face.  \\nThe HUM grows to a deafening roar! BOROMIR suddenly snaps out  \\nof his trance and hands the RING to FRODO. \\n      BOROMIR \\n   (lightly) \\n  As you wish. I care not.  \\nBOROMIR smiles at FRODO, ruffling his hair. \\n CLOSE ON: ARAGORN unhands his SWORD. \\n \\n      CUT TO:  \\nEXT. ISENGARD - DAY \\n \\nFollowing the CROWS as they race deeper and deeper, passing a \\nvista of INDUSTRY, HUNDREDS OF ORCS and writhing BIRTHSACKS ... flying past SARUMAN, who stands upon a wooden GANTRY. \\n \\nCLOSE ON: SARUMAN, listening to the CRIES of the CROWS.  \\n     SARUMAN \\n  So, Gandalf ... you try to lead them     over Caradhras. And if that fails ...  \\n  where then will you go?  \\n \\nINSERT IMAGE: The FELLOWSHIP struggles through the SNOW on \\nCARADHRAS.  \\n     SARUMAN (V.O.)

A LIGHTNING CRACK explodes on the mountainside above \\nthem.  \\n ANGLE ON: FRODO looks up in HORROR as a huge snow avalanche \\nthunders down towards them! \\n ANGLES ON: LEGOLAS pulls GANDALF to safety. ARAGORN shields \\nFRODO and SAM as snow piles around them. Within moments, the \\nPASS is blocked and the FELLOWSHIP are enveloped in snow. BOROMIR and ARAGORN frantically dig for the HOBBITS ... who are \\npulled out SHIVERING and FEARFUL. \\n \\n     BOROMIR \\n   (urgent)   We must get off the mountain! Make for  \\n  the Gap of Rohan and take the West road  \\n  to my city!  \\n     ARAGORN \\n  The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to    Isengard. \\n \\n     GIMLI \\n  We cannot pass over a mountain. Let us  \\n  go under it. Let us go through the    Mines of Moria. \\n \\nANGLE ON: GANDALF has a concerned look on his face.  \\n     SARUMAN (V.O.) \\n  Moria. You fear to go into those mines,   don’t you? The Dwarves delved too  \\n  greedily and too deep. \\n INT. ORTHANC ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY \\n \\nANGLE ON: SARUMAN sits in ORTHANC reviewing an ancient text. \\n \\nCLOSE ON: The BOOK showing the DOOR to MORIA.  \\n     SARUMAN (CONT’D) \\n  You know what they awoke in the darkness   of Khazad-dûm.

You feel its power growing,  \\n  don’t you? I’ve felt it too. You must be  \\n  careful now. Evil will be drawn to you  \\n  from outside the Fellowship. And, I fear,  \\n  from within.  \\nANGLE ON: BOROMIR passes them. They glance at him. \\n      FRODO \\n   (subdued) \\n  Who then do I trust?  \\n     GANDALF \\n  You must trust yourself. Trust   your own strengths. \\n \\n     FRODO \\n  What do you mean? \\n      GANDALF \\n  There are many powers in this  \\n  world for good or for evil. Some   are greater than I am.

MORIA GATE - NIGHT \\n \\nFooting is treacherous on the narrow strips of green and greasy stones. \\n \\nANGLE ON: GIMLI taps the WALL with his axe, listening.

He begins to push on \\nthe doors, but they remain fast. \\n    GANDALF \\n I once knew every spell in all  \\n the tongues of Elves, Men, and   Orcs. \\n \\n   PIPPIN \\n What are you going to do, then? \\n    GANDALF \\n  (angrily) \\n Knock your head against these doors,   Peregrin Took! And if that does not  \\n shatter them, and I am allowed a little \\n peace from foolish questions, I will  try to find the opening words. \\n \\n    LATER: \\n \\nGANDALF CONTINUES...  \\nMUMBLING spells in his efforts to open the door. \\n    GANDALF \\n  (wearily) \\n Ando Eldarinwa ... a lasta quettanya,   Fenda Casarinwa... \\n \\n Gate of Elves ... listen to my word,   Threshold of Dwarves... \\n \\nANGLE ON: SAM packs pots and pans at his feet ... watching sadly \\nas ARAGORN unsaddles BILL THE PONY. \\n CLOSE ON: ARAGORN whispering to BILL THE PONY. \\n \\n       (CONTINUED) 118. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n     ARAGORN    (whispering) \\n  Mines are no place for a Pony, even one  \\n  so brave as Bill. \\n \\n     SAM   Bye, Bill. \\n \\n     ARAGORN   Go on, Bill, go on ... don't worry,  \\n  Sam ... he knows his way home. \\n ARAGORN slaps BILL on the rump ...

PIPPIN is about to throw another \\nstone, but ARAGORN grabs his arm. \\n      ARAGORN \\n   (ominous) \\n  Do not disturb the water.  \\nARAGORN watches anxiously as the RIPPLES appear to grow ... he \\nexchanges a look with BOROMIR.  \\nARAGORN’S hand creeps towards his sword.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: GANDALF gives up in despair ... he sits down beside \\nFRODO.  \\nCLOSE ON: FRODO peers at the ELVISH INSCRIPTION ... his face \\nbreaks into a smile of comprehension.  \\n     FRODO \\n   (quietly)   It's a riddle... \\n \\nGANDALF raises his eyebrows...  \\n     FRODO \\n  Speak, friend, and enter.

This, my friend, is the home    of my cousin Balin ... And they call  \\n  this a mine.  \\n   (snorting) \\n  A mine! \\n ANGLE ON: A GLOW from GANDALF’S STAFF suddenly lights the \\nchamber ... The FELLOWSHIP recoil in HORROR! Many DWARF \\nSKELETONS are strewn about, clearly in the dead of some old battle ... the rusting armor and shields are peppered with \\narrows and axes \\n      BOROMIR \\n   (grimly) \\n  This is no mine ...

The dark water BOILS as the hideous \\nbeast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP!  \\n Again the creature grabs FRODO and pulls him to the lake.

MORIA MITHRIL MINE - NIGHT  \\nANGLE ON: The FELLOWSHIP enter a CHAMBER with old ropes and \\nancient ladders.   \\nANGLE ON: GANDALF touches a shining substance on the wall. \\n      GANDALF \\n  The wealth of Moria was not in gold or  \\n  jewels but mithril.  \\nGANDALF holds his staff over the expansive drop beside them. The \\nFELLOWSHIP looks down.  \\n \\n ANGLE ON: The ENDLESS DEPTH of the mine. A FAINT, BLUE GLOW \\nissues from its depths. It looks all but abandoned.  \\n The FELLOWSHIP continues onward. \\n \\n     GANDALF   Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings \\n  that Thorin gave him. \\n \\n     GIMLI \\n  Oh, that was a kingly gift.  \\n     GANDALF \\n  Yes. I never told him, but its worth    was greater than the value of the  \\n  Shire. \\n CLOSE ON: FRODO’S eyes widen. \\n \\n      CUT TO:  \\nINT. MORIA CEMETERY CAVERN - NIGHT \\n \\nThey continue up a steep stair, passing through a DWARF \\nCEMETERY. The graves are despoiled ... DWARF SKELETONS are strewn about and GOBLIN GRAFFITI is scrawled on monuments in \\nDRIED DWARF BLOOD. THE ATMOSPHERE is very sinister. \\n       CUT TO: \\n 122. \\n \\n INT. MORIA TUNNEL FORK - NIGHT \\n \\nThe path splits into three passages ... each disappearing into dark tunnel. GANDALF pauses, frowning. \\n \\n     GANDALF \\n  I have no memory of this place.  \\n LATER... \\n \\nTHE FELLOWSHIP are nervously waiting ... while GANDALF sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of him. He \\nappears to be in some kind of trance. \\n CLOSE ON: FRODO turns at the sound of a faint noise down the \\ntunnel behind them. \\n      PIPPIN \\n  Are we lost? \\n \\n     MERRY \\n  No. I don’t think we are. Shhh,    Gandalf’s thinking. \\n \\n     PIPPIN   Merry! \\n \\n     MERRY   What? \\n \\n     PIPPIN \\n  I'm hungry. \\n FRODO’S POV: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the \\ndarkness. FRODO is nervous...he approaches GANDALF. \\n      FRODO \\n   (whispers) \\n  There's something down there.  \\n     GANDALF \\n   (quietly)   It's Gollum.  \\n \\n     FRODO \\n  Gollum! \\n      GANDALF \\n  He's been following us for three  \\n  days.  \\n      (CONTINUED) 123. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nTEASING SHOT: An emaciated, leering creature.  \\n     FRODO \\n   (disbelieving) \\n  He escaped from the dungeons of Barad-dûr? \\n      GANDALF \\n  Escaped ... or was set loose. And now  \\n  the Ring has drawn him here ... he will    never be rid of his need for it. He  \\n  hates and loves the Ring, as he hates  \\n  and loves himself. Sméagol’s life is a    sad story.  \\n \\nGANDALF catches FRODO’S look of surprise.  \\n     GANDALF (CONT’D) \\n  Yes ... Sméagol he was once called ...  \\n  Before the Ring came to him, before it  \\n  drove him mad.  \\nGOLLUM’S withered fingers are gripping the cave wall ... his \\nLARGE LUMINOUS eyes blinking with malice.  \\n     FRODO \\n   (grim)   It’s a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when  \\n  he had the chance. \\n \\n     GANDALF \\n  Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo’s    hand. Many that live deserve death,  \\n  and some that die deserve life. Can you \\n  give it to  them, Frodo?  \\n \\nFRODO frowns. \\n      GANDALF (CONT’D) \\n  Do not be too eager to deal out death  \\n  in judgment ... even the very wise    cannot see all ends. My heart tells me  \\n  that Gollum has some part to play yet,  \\n  for good or ill before this is over.  \\n  The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of  \\n  many.  \\n     FRODO \\n  I wish the Ring had never come to me     ... I wish none of this had happened. \\n      (CONTINUED) 124. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\n     GANDALF   So do all who live to see such times,  \\n  but that is not for them to decide. All  \\n  we have to decide is what to do with  \\n  the time that is given to us.  \\n There is a note of finality in GANDALF’S voice. \\n \\n     GANDALF (CONT’D)   There are other forces at work in this  \\n  world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.  \\n  Bilbo was meant to find the Ring. In    which case, you also were meant to have  \\n  it ... and that is an encouraging  \\n  thought.     (sudden brightness) \\n  Ah! It's that way. \\n \\nGANDALF points at the right hand tunnel ... the FELLOWSHIP \\nscramble to their feet.  \\n     MERRY \\n   (relieved)   He's remembered! \\n \\n     GANDALF   No. But the air doesn’t smell so foul  \\n  down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc,  \\n  always follow your nose! \\n   (laughs) \\n  Yes...  \\nINT. DWARROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA - DAY \\n The FELLOWSHIP pass under an arched doorway into a black and \\nempty space. GANDALF pauses... \\n      GANDALF \\n  Let me risk a little more light. \\n GANDALF taps his staff ... for a brief moment a light blazes ... \\nlike a silent FLASH OF LIGHTNING. GREAT SHADOWS spring up and \\nflee... \\n \\n     GANDALF   Behold! The great realm and Dwarf-city  \\n  of Dwarrowdelf. \\n       (CONTINUED) 125. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO gasps at the brief sight of a roof, far above their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars of stone.  \\n \\nBefore them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls, \\npolished and smooth as glass. \\n      SAM \\n  Well, there's an eye opener and no \\n  mistake!  \\nAhead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. BLACK ARROWS are \\nembedded in the timbers. TWO GOBLIN SKELETONS lie in the doorway. GIMLI rushes ahead... \\n \\n     GANDALF   Gimli!! \\n \\n      CUT TO: \\n \\nINT. BALIN’S TOMB, MORIA - DAY  \\nGIMLI rushes into another vast empty chamber ... lit with a \\nnarrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near the roof. DWARF AND GOBLIN SKELETONS are piled high. In the far \\ncorner sits a stone walled WELL. A SHAFT OF LIGHT falls directly \\nonto a stone table in the middle of the room: a single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great slab of white \\nstone. GIMLI falls to his knees... \\n \\n     GIMLI \\n  No...no...oh, no!  \\nGIMLI sobs. \\n GANDALF quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto the \\nwhite stone slab. \\n      GANDALF \\n  “Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of  \\n  Moria.” He is dead, then. It’s as I feared.  \\n     GIMLI \\n (chanting softly, sobbing) \\n Kilmin malur ni zaram kalil ra  \\n  narag. Kheled-zâram ... Balin    tazlifi. \\n \\n       (CONTINUED) 126. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nGANDALF carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from the white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed ... and \\nappears to be covered in DRIED BLOOD. The pages crack and break \\nas he opens it. \\n \\n     LEGOLAS    (urgent whisper to Aragorn) \\n  We must move on. We cannot linger. \\n      GANDALF \\n   (reading) \\n  “They have taken the Bridge and the    second hall: we have barred the  \\n  gates ... but cannot hold them for \\n   long ... the ground shakes ... drums  \\n   drums in the deep ... we cannot get \\n   out. A shadow moves in the dark. Will \\n  no-one save us? They are coming.” \\n \\nANGLE ON: Unnerved, PIPPIN backs away nervously ... He stumbles against the well, sending a precariously balanced ARMORED \\nSKELETON tumbling in!  \\n MERRY reaches out, GRABBING hold of PIPPIN before he falls. THE \\nFELLOWSHIP freeze in stunned silence as the armored skeleton \\nclatters down the deep well ... echoing loudly!  \\nANGLE ON: GANDALF turns angrily on PIPPIN. \\n \\n     GANDALF \\n   (angrily)   Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next  \\n  time, and rid us of your stupidity! \\n ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, CHASTENED. \\n \\nThey fall silent. A low rolling BOOM rises from the depths below ... growing louder ... BOOM ... BOOM ... as if the caverns of \\nMORIA were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts nearby \\n... ANSWERING horns ... running feet ... harsh cries ...   \\nCLOSE ON: SAM’S eyes glance at FRODO’S belt... \\n \\n     SAM \\n   (worried)   Mr. Frodo! \\n \\n       (CONTINUED) 127. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from STING’S SCABBARD! FRODO draws the SWORD ... and stares at its \\nglowing blade! \\n \\n     LEGOLAS \\n  Orcs!  \\n     ARAGORN \\n   (to the Hobbits)   Get back! Stay close to Gandalf. \\n \\nARAGORN and BOROMIR slam and wedge the doors. BOROMIR catches sight of something; he turns to ARAGORN with shock in his eyes. \\n \\n     BOROMIR   They have a cave-troll! \\n \\nANGLE ON: GIMLI snatches up two rusty Dwarf axes and leaps onto \\nthe tomb. \\n      GIMLI \\n   (yelling) \\n  Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in    Moria who still draws breath! \\n \\nBOOM! The door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments, and 20 GOBLINS charge into the tomb, followed by a HUGH CAVE TROLL! \\n \\nANGLES ON: GIMLI ducks a blow and immediately buries his AXES in \\n2 GOBLIN HELMETS. ARAGORN and BOROMIR wade into the mass of \\nGOBLINS with their swords. LEGOLAS fires deadly arrows into GOBLIN throats, desperately trying to SHIELD the HOBBITS! \\nGANDALF is clutching his sword, GLAMDRING, and joins in the \\nbattle!  \\nANGLES ON: The CAVE TROLL is sweeping his club at ARAGORN ... \\nwho stumbles backwards ... the huge club descends for the killing blow ... SUDDENLY, in a FLASH OF STEEL, BOROMIR’S long \\nsword SLICES into the SCALY ARM of the TROLL; it rears back, \\nSPEWING GREEN BLOOD!  \\nANGLES ON: SAM is backed up against a wall .. a sword in one \\nhand, a SAUCEPAN in the other. In desperation he swings wildly \\nat a GOBLIN with the saucepan! It keels over ... SAM looks \\nsurprised. He wallops another GOBLIN and it too, drops.  \\n SAM \\n  I think I’m getting the hang of this.  \\n (CONTINUED) 128. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (3) \\n \\nANGLE ON: The CAVE TROLL lunges forward, thrusting at FRODO’S chest with his spear. \\n \\n FRODO \\n Aragorn! Aragorn! \\n SAM screams as FRODO is lifted off his feet by the spear tip and \\nslammed against the wall. \\n  ARAGORN \\n (shocked yell) \\n  Frodo!  \\nANGLES ON: The HOBBITS go crazy. SAM slashes at the CAVE TROLL’S \\nknee, bringing him down ... MERRY and PIPPIN jump on him ... LEGOLAS fires an arrow ... and the CAVE TROLL topples, dead. \\n \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN rushes to FRODO’S side as he slumps to the \\nfloor ... FRODO appears to be dead. \\n CLOSE ON: GANDALF, ARAGORN, HOBBITS looking horrified... \\n \\nSUDDENLY, FRODO coughs ... takes a huge breath.  \\n     SAM \\n  He's alive.  \\n     FRODO \\n  I'm all right. I'm not hurt. \\n \\n     ARAGORN   You should be dead. That spear would  \\n  have skewered a wild boar. \\n      GANDALF \\n  I think there’s more to this Hobbit  \\n  than meets the eye.  \\nANGLE ON: FRODO opens his shirt to reveal the MITHRIL VEST. The \\nTROLL SPEAR did not pierce the MITHRIL.  \\n     GIMLI \\n  Mithril! You are full of surprises,  \\n  Master Baggins. \\n BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. the sound of the drums rings out again! \\nGANDALF turns to the other. \\n       (CONTINUED) 129. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (4) \\n \\n     GANDALF   To the bridge of Khazad-Dûm! \\n \\n      CUT TO: \\n \\nINT. DWARROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA - DAY  \\nGANDALF leads the FELLOWSHIP into the huge DWARROWDELF CHAMBER. \\n      GANDALF \\n  This way! \\n They hurry towards a distant door ... as GOBLINS start scuttling \\ndown the PILLARS behind them, like cockroaches! \\n ANGLE ON: FRODO looks with horror at the overwhelming GOBLIN \\narmy that’s rushing towards them! \\n \\nSUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills the air! A fiery light dances \\ndown the hallway ... the pillars castings eerie shadows.  \\nANGLES ON: The GOBLINS freeze. They back fearfully away from the \\napproaching beast ... melting into the darkness.  \\n     BOROMIR \\n  What is this new devilry?  \\nA HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by FLAME, falls across the hall ... \\nthe ground shakes ... an unearthly sound rumbles. \\n \\n     GANDALF    (quietly) \\n  A Balrog ... a demon of the ancient world!  \\n  This foe is beyond any of you!     (urgent yell) \\n  Run! Quickly! \\n       CUT TO: \\n \\nINT. STAIRWAY OF KHAZAD-DÛM, MORIA - DAY  \\nThe BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great 40-\\nFOOT MAN-BEAST, with a MANE OF FLAMES! In one hand is a BLADE \\n... like a stabbing TONGUE OF FIRE; in the other, a WHIP of MANY \\nTHONGS.  \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN leads the FELLOWSHIP to the top of a dizzying \\nstairway ... GANDALF follows, leaning heavily on his staff.  \\n      (CONTINUED) 130. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nCLOSE ON: ARAGORN looks at GANDALF, concerned.  \\n     GANDALF \\n  Lead them on, Aragorn! The bridge is  \\n  near.  \\n ARAGORN hesitates ... GANDALF looks at him. \\n \\n     GANDALF (CONT’D)   Do as I say; Swords are no more use \\n  here. \\n The FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway.  \\n \\nARAGORN picks up FRODO ... leaping across a gaping chasm ... GANDALF yells to the others.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN makes to throw GIMLI across the chasm. \\n \\n     GIMLI   Nobody tosses a dwarf! \\n \\nThe BALROG smashes through the wall and spreads its VAST WINGS. It swoops down past the FELLOWSHIP, disappearing into a FLAMING \\nPIT! \\n       CUT TO: \\n \\nINT. BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DÛM, MORIA - DAY \\n \\nThe FELLOWSHIP run into the SECOND HALL ... the floor is split with fissures that spit flame. \\n \\n     GANDALF    (yelling) \\n  Over the bridge! Fly! \\n They race towards the slender bridge of stone ... without kerb \\nor rail ... at the far end of the hall. The FELLOWSHIP \\nrecklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge .. but GANDALF ... the last ... pauses in the middle of the span ... he faces the \\nBALROG ... staff in one hand ... GLAMDRING in the other! \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO looks back in horror: \\n      GANDALF (CONT’D) \\n  You cannot pass! \\n       (CONTINUED) 131. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n     FRODO    (alarmed yell) \\n  Gandalf! \\n \\n     GANDALF \\n   (yelling)   I am a servant of the Secret Fire,  \\n  wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark  \\n  fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn.  \\nFRODO watches as the BALROG puts one foot on the bridge and \\ndraws up to FULL HEIGHT, wings spreading from wall-to-wall. GANDALF is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow \\nbridge. \\n      GANDALF (CONT’D) \\n  Go back to the Shadow!  \\n \\nThe BALROG slashes at GANDALF with its SWORD OF FLAME ... \\nGANDALF blocks with GLAMDRING ... a ringing clash and the BALROG’S SWORD SHATTERS into MOLTEN FRAGMENTS! \\n \\n     GANDALF    (booming) \\n  You shall not pass!! \\n The BALROG places one foot onto the bridge. \\n \\n     ARAGORN \\n  He cannot stand alone!

For a moment, the great BEAST  remains poised in the air \\n... then it plunges down:  \\n \\n      (CONTINUED) 132. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\nSLOW MOTION: RELIEF floods FRODO’S face ... GANDALF remains trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. \\n \\nSLOW MOTION: As the BALROG falls, he lashes out with his whip of \\nfire... \\n SLOW MOTION: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around \\nGANDALF’S knees, dragging him over the brink! GANDALF just \\nmanages to hang on by his fingertips.  \\n     FRODO \\n   (screaming)   Gandalf! \\n \\n     GANDALF    (fierce) \\n  Fly, you fools! \\n \\nCLOSE ON: GANDALF lets go his grip and falls away ... following \\nthe BALROG into the BOTTOMLESS ABYSS!  \\nFRODO cries out! BOROMIR scoops him up and carries him away! \\n      FRODO \\n  No! \\n      ARAGORN \\n  Gandalf! \\n \\nThey rush towards an archway. \\n       CUT TO: \\n \\nEXT. DIMRILL DALE DOOR - DAY  \\nThe FELLOWSHIP tumble out of the GREAT EASTERN GATE on to a \\ngrassy sunlit hillside. SAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN fall slowly to the ground, SOBBING ...  \\n \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to LEGOLAS and GIMLI.  \\n     ARAGORN \\n   (urgent) \\n  Legolas, get them up. \\n      BOROMIR \\n  Give them a moment ... for pity's sake! \\n       (CONTINUED) 133. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n     ARAGORN   By nightfall these hills will be  \\n  swarming with Orcs!

EDGE OF LOTHLÓRIEN - DUSK  \\nWIDE ON: The FELLOWSHIP run across a forest floor strewn with \\nYELLOW FLOWERS ... above is a ROOF OF GOLDEN LEAVES, held up by \\nSILVER PILLARS ... the TRUNKS of HUGE, GREY TREES.  \\n ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS, taking in the surroundings as if a return \\nhome. \\n      LEGOLAS \\n   (musing) \\n  Ah, Lothlórien. The fairest of all the    dwellings of my people. There are no  \\n  trees like the trees of this land, for  \\n  in autumn the leaves fall not, but turn    to gold. Not till the spring comes and  \\n  the new green opens do they fall, and  \\n  then the boughs are laden with yellow  \\n  flowers; and the floor of the wood is  \\n  golden, and golden is the roof, and its    pillars are of silver, for the bark of  \\n  the trees is smooth and grey. So still  \\n  our songs in Mirkwood say.  \\n      (CONTINUED) 134. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nANGLE ON: In contrast, GIMLI looks nervously around...  \\n     GIMLI \\n  Stay close, young Hobbits ... they say \\n  a great sorceress lives in these woods.  \\n  An Elf-witch of terrible power.

Frodo... \\n \\n     GIMLI   And are never seen again! \\n \\n     GALADRIEL (V.O.) \\n  ...your coming to us is as the  \\n  footsteps of doom.

I have the eyes of a  \\n  hawk and the ears of a fox! \\n \\nThe FELLOWSHIP are suddenly surrounded by ARMED ELVES. DEADLY ARROWS are aimed at their heads. HALDIR, the ELVISH CAPTAIN, \\nsteps forward... \\n      HALDIR \\n  The Dwarf breathes so loud we could  \\n  have shot him in the dark.  \\n      CUT TO: \\n INT. CERIN AMROTH, LOTHLÓRIEN - NIGHT \\n \\nNight is deepening amongst the windy trees. The FELLOWSHIP \\nstands on a platform in the trees.

Speak words we can  \\n also understand! \\n    HALDIR \\n We have not had dealings with the  \\n Dwarves since the Dark Days.  \\n   GIMLI \\n And you know what this Dwarf says   to that? Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul! \\n \\n I spit on your grave!  \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN takes GIMLI by the arm. \\n \\n   ARAGORN \\n  (stern)  That was not so courteous. \\n \\nHALDIR moves on to FRODO.  \\n    (CONTINUED) 136. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\n   HALDIR  You bring great evil with you. \\n  (to ARAGORN) \\n You can go no further. \\n \\nHALDIR walks away.   \\nANGLE ON: SAM and PIPPIN turn to look at FRODO. FRODO appears \\nuncomfortable.  \\nLATER... \\n The FELLOWSHIP sit while ARAGORN speaks with HALDIR. \\n \\n   ARAGORN  Boe ammen veriad lîn. Andelu i ven!  \\n \\n We need your protection. The road  \\n is fell! \\n HALDIR whispers back inaudibly. \\n \\n   ARAGORN  Merin le telim.  \\n \\n I wish we may come with you.  \\nHALDIR answers quietly, again so that only ARAGORN can hear his  \\nwords. \\n \\n   ARAGORN  Henio, aníron boe ammen i dulu  \\n lîn!  \\n  Please, understand, we need  \\n your support! \\n ANGLE ON: FRODO looks to the remainder of the FELLOWSHIP. As \\nthey meet his eyes, they look away, as if he has become a \\nscourge to them.  \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN continues to argue loudly with HALDIR.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO, looking at his friends, sees blame that does \\nnot truly exist anywhere but in his mind. He is alone, it seems.   \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN pleads with HALDIR. \\n     (CONTINUED) 137. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (3) \\n \\n   ARAGORN  Andelu i ven.  \\n \\n The road is very dangerous. \\n \\nANGLE ON: BOROMIR approaches FRODO.  \\n   BOROMIR \\n Gandalf's death was not in vain.  nor would he have you give up hope.  \\n You carry a heavy burden, Frodo. \\n Don't carry the weight of the dead.  \\nHALDIR stands before FRODO. \\n    HALDIR \\n Very well. Here we will stay awhile,  \\n and come to the city of Galadhrim on  \\n the morrow. \\n INT. CERIN AMROTH, LOTHLÓRIEN - DAY \\n \\nANGLE ON: SAM and FRODO sit on one of the many platforms in the trees at CERIN AMROTH. SAM suddenly looks up and around, with a \\npuzzled expression. He rubs his eyes. \\n    FRODO \\n What is it? \\n \\n   SAM \\n It’s an odd thing, Mr. Frodo. It’s  sunlight and bright day, right enough. \\n I thought that Elves were all for moon \\n and stars. But this is more Elvish than  anything I ever heard tell of. I feel \\n as if I was inside a song, if you take \\n my meaning.  \\n   HALDIR \\n  (from behind them)  You feel the power of the Lady of \\n Galadhrim. Would it please you to \\n climb with me up Cerin Amroth? \\n \\nWIDE ON: FRODO and SAM follow HALDIR up a long series of platforms until they reach the pinnacle of the trees.  \\n \\n     (CONTINUED) 138. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM approach the edge of a high platform and look out in wonder.  \\n \\nHIGH WIDE SHOT: MIDDLE EARTH stretches out for miles and miles \\nto the NORTH. Far to the NORTH, a shadow lingers over the FOREST \\nOF MIRKWOOD.  \\nANGLE ON: HALDIR points the HOBBITS’ gaze to the dark cloud. \\n    HALDIR \\n There lies the fastness of Southern \\n Mirkwood. It is clad in a forest of  dark fir, where the trees strive one  \\n against another and their branches rot \\n and whither. In the midst upon a stony  height stands Dol Guldur, where long \\n the hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We \\n fear that now it is inhabited again, \\n and with power sevenfold. A black cloud \\n lies often over it of late.   \\nPAN ON WIDE SHOT: From ORTHANC to the WEST across the \\nmagnificent view to MORDOR and BARAD-DÛR in the EAST.  \\n   HALDIR (CONT’D) \\n In this high place you may see the two  powers that are oppose one to another; \\n and ever they strive now in thought, \\n but whereas the light perceives the \\n very heart of the darkness, its own \\n secret has not been discovered. Not  yet. \\n \\nANGLE ON: HALDIR leaves the high place. With a final look, FRODO and SAM follow. \\n \\nINT. CERIN AMROTH, LOTHLÓRIEN - DAY  \\nCLOSE ON: A SMALL GOLDEN FLOWER in someone’s hand. \\n ANGLE ON: ARAGORN, admiring the beauty of this flower. \\n \\n   ARAGORN \\n Arwen vanimelda, namárië. \\n ANGLE ON: FRODO approaches. ARAGORN sighs, and then turns to \\nFRODO and smiles.  \\n     (CONTINUED) 139. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n   ARAGORN  Here is the heart of Elvendom on earth,  \\n and here my heart dwells ever, unless \\n there be a light beyond the dark roads \\n that we still must tread, you and I. \\n    FRODO \\n Do you believe we may yet succeed \\n in our quest?  \\n   ARAGORN \\n We shall endure to the last.   \\n    CUT TO: \\n EXT. LOTHLÓRIEN HILLTOP - DAY \\n \\nHALDIR leads the FELLOWSHIP onto a HILL TOP. They look with \\nwonderment at the vista spread before them. \\n WIDE ON: Several miles towards the SOUTH, a LARGE HILL rises out \\nof the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty MALLORN TREES, \\ntaller than any others ... NESTLED high in the crown of the mallorns is a BEAUTIFUL CITY. It GLEAMS in the low rays of the \\nlate afternoon ... green, gold, and silver. To the east of CARAS \\nGALADHON, the WOODS of LÓRIEN run down the pale gleam of ANDUIN, the great river.  \\n \\nBeyond the RIVER, the land appears flat and empty, formless and \\nvague, until far away, it rises again like a dark dreary wall. \\nThe SUN that lies on LOTHLÓRIEN has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie beyond. \\n \\n   HALDIR  Caras Galadon. The heart of Elvendom on \\n earth. This is the city of Galadhrim \\n where dwell the Lord Celeborn and of  Galadriel, Lady of Light. \\n \\n    CUT TO:  \\nEXT. CELEBORN’S CHAMBER, CARAS GALADHON - NIGHT \\n \\nANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP step onto a wide fleet filled with a \\nsoft light. The walls are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the trunk of the mighty MALLORN TREE, now tapering \\ntoward its crown. \\n       (CONTINUED) 140. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nANGLE ON: CELEBORN steps forward to greet the guests. His hair is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no sign \\nof age upon it. Next to him stands GALADRIEL, the LADY OF THE \\nELVES. She has hair of deep gold and timeless unsurpassed \\nbeauty. \\n ANGLE ON: CELEBORN looks hard at ARAGORN... \\n \\n     CELEBORN   The enemy knows you have entered here.  \\n  What hope you had in secrecy is now  \\n  gone. Eight there are here, yet nine    there were set out from Rivendell.  \\n  Tell me, where is Gandalf? For I much  \\n  desire to speak with him. I can no    longer see him from afar. \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO looks at GALADRIEL, standing silently beside \\nCELEBORN. \\n      GALADRIEL \\n   (softly aloud) \\n  Gandalf the Grey did not pass the    borders of this land. He has fallen  \\n  into Shadow.  \\n      LEGOLAS \\n  He was taken by both Shadow and flame.  \\n  A Balrog of Morgoth. For we went  \\n  needlessly into the net of Moria. \\n ANGLE ON: The FELLOWSHIP bow their heads in sadness at the \\nmemory of GANDALF. \\n ANGLE ON: CELEBORN appears surprised. \\n \\n     GALADRIEL   Needless were none of the deeds of  \\n  Gandalf in life. We do not yet know his  \\n  full purpose.   \\nGALADRIEL surveys the face of the FELLOWSHIP. \\n \\nCLOSE ON: GIMLI looks up as GALADRIEL addresses him. \\n  \\n      (CONTINUED) 141. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\n     GALADRIEL   Do not let the great emptiness of  \\n  Khazad-dûm fill your heart Gimli, son  \\n  of Glóin. For the world has grown full  \\n  of peril, and in all lands, love is now  \\n  mingled with grief.  \\nANGLE ON: GALADRIEL looks over he FELLOWSHIP again to meet her \\ngaze with BOROMIR’S.  \\nCLOSE ON: BOROMIR is suddenly fearful and nervous. \\n CLOSE ON: GALADRIEL’S eyes piercing BOROMIR. \\n \\nANGLE ON: BOROMIR turns away from her.  \\nANGLE ON: GALADRIEL’S gaze remains on him for a moment before \\nturning to CELEBORN. \\n \\n     CELEBORN   What now becomes of this Fellowship?  \\n  Without Gandalf, hope is lost. \\n ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL looks to ARAGORN. \\n \\n     GALADRIEL   The quest stands upon the edge of a  \\n  knife. Stray but a little and it will  \\n  fail, to the ruin of all... Yet hope  \\n  remains while the company is true.  \\n GALADRIEL’S eyes settle on SAM. \\n \\n     GALADRIEL   Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go  \\n  now and rest, for you are weary with  \\n  sorrow and much toil.   \\nGALADRIEL’S eyes turn to FRODO ... her voice fades. \\n      GALADRIEL \\n  Tonight you will sleep in peace. \\n   (whispered v/o) \\n  Welcome, Frodo of the Shire... \\n CLOSE ON: FRODO looks at GALADRIEL. \\n \\n       (CONTINUED) 142. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (3) \\n \\nSUDDEN INSERT: GALADRIEL as she is on the other side ... POWERFUL, DIVINE ... no longer of this world ... a PIERCING \\nwhite light surrounds her.  \\n \\n \\n     GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D)   ...one who has seen the eye. \\n \\n      CUT TO:  \\nEXT. CARAS GALADON, LOTHLÓRIEN - NIGHT \\n GIMLI, LEGOLAS, MERRY, PIPPIN, FRODO, and SAM are in a pavilion \\nset among the trees near the fountain. They lie on soft couches \\nas ELVES leave food and wine for them. MOURNFUL SINGING drifts down from the trees above. \\n \\n     LEGOLAS \\n   (sadly) \\n  A lament for Gandalf...  \\n     MERRY \\n  What do they say about him?  \\n     LEGOLAS \\n  I have not the heart to tell you. For me,    the grief is still too near. \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO lies on his bed watching the others. SAM works \\nwith PIPPIN. \\n      SAM \\n  I bet they don’t mention his  \\n  fireworks. There should be a verse    about them. \\n \\nANGLE ON: SAM stands up to add his own verse to the ELVEN SONG.  \\n     SAM \\n  The finest rockets ever seen   They burst in stars of blue and green \\n  Or after thunder, silver showers \\n  Come falling like a rain of flowers.  \\n  Oh, that doesn’t do them justice  \\n  by a long road.  \\nSAM sits down, frustrated and disappointed with himself.  \\n       (CONTINUED) 143. \\n \\n CONTINUED:  \\n \\nANGLE ON: BOROMIR is sitting alone ... ARAGORN approaches him.  \\n \\n     ARAGORN \\n  Take some rest. These borders are well \\n  protected.  \\nANGLE ON: Moonlight catches the trace of tears on BOROMIR’S \\nface. ARAGORN kneels beside him.  \\n     BOROMIR \\n  I will find no rest here. I heard her    voice inside my head. She spoke of my  \\n  father and the fall of Gondor. She said  \\n  to me, “Even now, there is hope left.”    But I cannot see it ... it is long since  \\n  we had any  hope.  \\n \\nCLOSE ON: BOROMIR looks at ARAGORN in despair. \\n      BOROMIR (CONT’D) \\n  My father is a noble man, but his rule  \\n  is failing, and our ... our people lose    faith. He looks to me to make things  \\n  right ... and I would do it, I would  \\n  see the glory of Gondor restored. Have    you ever seen it, Aragorn? The White  \\n  Tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like a  \\n  spike of pearl and silver, its banners  \\n  caught high in the morning breeze ...  \\n  have you ever been called home by the    clear ringing of silver trumpets? \\n \\n     ARAGORN   I have seen the White City ... long  \\n  ago. \\n BOROMIR feels ARAGORN’S love for MINAS TIRITH and takes heart. \\n \\n     BOROMIR   One day, our paths will lead us there,  \\n  and the tower guard will take up the  \\n  call “the Lords of Gondor have   \\n  returned.” \\n ARAGORN returns BOROMIR’S smile ... betraying his disquiet \\nsadness only when BOROMIR looks away. \\n 144. \\n \\n LATER... \\n \\nThe FELLOWSHIP are asleep on their beds. GIMLI is snoring loudly. \\n \\nCLOSE ON: BARE FEET treads soundlessly across the lawn. \\n \\nCLOSE ON: FRODO’S EYES FLICKER OPEN ... as if by instinct.  \\nANGLE ON: GALADRIEL, her WHITE dress glowing in the moonlight, \\nglances at him. FRODO follows her ... as if drawn by an invisible force. \\n \\nEXT. GALADRIEL’S GLADE, LOTHLÓRIEN - NIGHT  \\nUpon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits a \\nshallow SILVER BASIN. GALADRIEL leads FRODO into the small GLADE. \\n \\n     GALADRIEL \\n  Will you look into the mirror? \\n ANGLE ON: FRODO looks with apprehension at the silver basin. \\n \\n     FRODO    (warily) \\n  What will I see? \\n GALADRIEL pours water into the basin from a silver jug ... a \\nGLOW rises from the water. \\n \\n     GALADRIEL \\n  Even the wisest cannot tell. For the    mirror shows many things ... things  \\n  that were ... things that are ... and  \\n  some things that have not yet come to    pass. \\n \\nFRODO slowly steps up to the PEDESTAL ... he peers into the glossy surface. The night sky is reflected in the water ... \\nsuddenly a figure takes form ... the bowed figure of an OLD MAN, \\nCLAD IN WHITE ROBES. He walks down a long road. FRODO leans closer to the mirror’s surface. \\n \\nCLOSE ON: GANDALF LIFTS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS DIRECTLY AT FRODO! \\n \\nFRODO gasps, his face lighting up with hope.  \\n     FRODO \\n   (joyous)   Gandalf! \\n \\n      (CONTINUED) 145. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nGANDALF looks at FRODO with a fierce intensity. FRODO reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror. Suddenly the \\nimage flares, burning out to white. \\n \\nTHE VISION SHIFTS ... FRODO gasps in horror! The SHIRE is in \\nruins!   \\nTHE IMAGE SUDDENLY WIDENS TO FILL THE SCREEN ... buildings \\nburning ... bodies strewn about ... DARK SHAPES of ORCS looting and destroying ... BAG END, billowing in flames! The Party Tree \\nis hacked down.  \\n ANGLE ON: FRODO reels back as the mirror seems to grow. The \\nnightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing him entirely.  \\n IMAGE: HOBBITON ... now an INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND. The fields and \\ntrees destroyed ... replaced with BRICK FACTORIES belching \\nsmoke!  \\n \\nIMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled HOBBITS into the FACTORIES! We see SAM ... MERRY ... and ROSIE COTTON. SOOT-STAINED and \\nSOBBING, they disappear into the factory hellhole! \\n SUDDENLY, the mirror goes dark ... and out of the black abyss a \\nSINGLE EYE GROWS. \\n CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable to move or cry out. The RING \\ndangles from his neck, inches above the water ... not shimmering \\nwith curls of steam. FIRE erupts around the EYE.  \\n \\nWITH A YELL, FRODO pushes himself away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. Light instantly fades from the mirror. \\nFRODO comes to his senses ... he is shocked.  \\n ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL stands still as a statue, unmoved, untouched \\nby the horror. \\n      GALADRIEL \\n  I know what it is you saw ... for it is  \\n  also in my mind. It is the future,     Frodo. It is what will come to pass if  \\n  you should fail.  \\n \\nGALADRIEL looks at FRODO intensely ... FRODO looks down ... in \\nhis hand he is clutching the RING. FRODO looks up at GALADRIEL.  \\n \\n      (CONTINUED) 146. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\n     GALADRIEL (CONT’D)   The Fellowship is breaking. It is  \\n  already begun. He will try to take the  \\n  Ring. You know of whom I speak. One by  \\n  one, it will destroy them all. \\n      FRODO (V.O.) \\n  If you ask it of me, I will give you  \\n  the One Ring.  \\n     GALADRIEL \\n  You offer it to me freely ... I do not    deny that my heart has greatly desired  \\n  this. \\n GALADRIEL suddenly seems to rise in stature before FRODO’S eyes. \\nFRODO is suddenly afraid of her. \\n \\n     GALADRIEL \\n  In place of the Dark Lord, you would    have a Queen, not dark, but beautiful  \\n  and terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous  \\n  as the Sea! Stronger than the    foundations of the earth ... All shall  \\n  love me and despair! \\n ANGLE ON: FRODO takes a step away from GALADRIEL...  \\n \\nANGLE ON: GALADRIEL suddenly laughs ... a slender ELF-WOMAN once \\nmore, clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.  \\n      GALADRIEL (CONT’D) \\n   (gently) \\n  I pass the test.     (laughs) \\n  I will diminish, and go into the West,  \\n  and remain  Galadriel. \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO’S confidence drains away. \\n      FRODO \\n  I cannot do this alone. \\n \\n     GALADRIEL \\n  You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a    Ring of Power is to be alone.  \\n \\n       (CONTINUED) 147. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (3) \\n \\nCLOSE ON: GALADRIEL raises her hand to show FRODO her own RING.  \\n     GALADRIEL (CONT’D) \\n  This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant. And \\n  I am its keeper. \\n GALADRIEL lowers her hand, hiding NENYA once more. \\n \\n     GALADRIEL (CONT’D)   This task was appointed to you. And \\n  if you do not find a way, no one will. \\n ANGLE ON: FRODO realizes what her message is. \\n \\n     FRODO   Then I know what I must do. It's   \\n  just I’m afraid to do it. \\n \\nGALADRIEL kneels down to FRODO’S height, staring at him \\nintently.  \\n     GALADRIEL \\n  Even the smallest person can change   the course of the future. \\n \\nCLOSE ON: THE RING lies in the palm of FRODO’S hand ... his fingers close over it. \\n \\n      CUT TO: \\n \\nINT. ORTHANC CHAMBER - DAY  \\nNAKED, LURTZ’S eyes follow SARUMAN, alight with a mean \\nintelligence.  \\n     SARUMAN \\n   (smiles)   Do you know how Orcs first came into  \\n  being? They were Elves once. Taken by  \\n  the Dark Powers ... tortured and    mutilated ... a ruined and terrible  \\n  form of life. And now perfected. My  \\n  fighting Uruk-Hai. Whom do you serve? \\n \\n     LURTZ    (guttural rasp) \\n  Saruman. \\n 148. \\n \\n INT. CAVERNS BELOW ISENGARD - DAY \\n \\nQUICK CUTS: LURTZ is quickly armored ... BREASTPLATE ... LEG GUARDS, HELMET ... a sword is thrust in LURTZ’S hand. The URUK-\\nHAI are smearing themselves in white paint ... a creepy \\nritualistic ceremony ... the WHITE HAND OF ISENGARD is smeared \\non bodies, faces, and armor. \\n ANGLE ON: SARUMAN addresses a crowd of 200 fully-armed URUK-HAI. \\n \\n     SARUMAN   Hunt them down. Do not stop until they  \\n  are found. You do not know pain. You do  \\n  not know fear. You will taste man-flesh.  \\nSARUMAN turns to LURTZ. \\n      SARUMAN (CONT’D) \\n   (coldly) \\n  One of the Halflings carries something  \\n  of great value ... bring them to me ... \\n  alive and unspoiled ... kill the    others. \\n \\nEXT. ISENGARD - DAY  \\nLURTZ is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of ISENGARD ... they run fast, \\ntheir powerful legs carrying them at speed.  \\nEXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK - DAWN \\n \\nThe mists of morning lay heavily along the river. Bare-branched  \\ntrees arch through the fogs, stray beams of light falling on the  cold, blue waters.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: GALADRIEL approaches the bank in an elegant ship, carved in the likeness of a swan.  \\n \\n      DISSOLVE TO:  \\nEXT. SILVERLODE SHORE, LOTHLÓRIEN - DAWN \\n CLOSE ON: An green, silver-veined ELVEN LEAF-BROOCH is clasped. \\n \\nANGLE ON: ELVES clasp ELVEN CLOAKS around on the FELLOWSHIP, \\neach with a leaf-brooch. \\n      CELEBORN (V.O.) \\n  Never before have we clad strangers \\n  in the garb of our own people.  \\n \\n      (CONTINUED) 149. \\n \\n CONTINUED:  \\n \\nANGLE ON: CELEBORN addresses the FELLOWSHIP.  \\n     CELEBORN (CONT’D) \\n  May these cloaks help shield you from \\n  unfriendly eyes. \\n EXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK, LOTHLÓRIEN - DAWN \\n \\nANGLE ON: LEGOLAS grabs a couple of packs and puts them in an Elven boat. MERRY and PIPPIN look up as he pulls a small piece \\nof bread from one of the packs. \\n      LEGOLAS \\n  Lembas. Elvish waybread. \\n He takes a bite. \\n \\n     LEGOLAS \\n  One small bite is enough to fill  \\n  the stomach of a grown Man.  \\nHe stuffs the remaining piece back in the pack and places it in \\nthe boats.   \\nANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN nod as he walks away.  \\n      MERRY \\n  How many did you eat? \\n  \\n     PIPPIN \\n  Four.  \\nMERRY nods and picks at his teeth. PIPPIN belches. \\n ANGLES ON: The FELLOWSHIP continue to load the boats for their \\njourney ... LEGOLAS helps GIMLI into a boat ... SAM crawls into \\nanother boat and quickly reveals he has no measure of sea legs.   \\n     CELEBORN (V.O.) \\n  Every league you travel south, the    danger will increase. Mordor Orcs now  \\n  hold the eastern shore of the Anduin.  \\n  Nor will you find safety on the western  \\n  bank. \\n 150. \\n \\n EXT. SILVERLODE SHORE, LOTHLÓRIEN - DAWN \\n \\nANGLE ON: CELEBORN and ARAGORN walks toward the RIVER.  \\n     CELEBORN \\n  Strange creatures bearing the White \\n  Hand have been seen on our borders. \\n  Seldom do Orcs journey in the open  \\n  under the sun, yet these have done so. \\n \\nCLOSE ON: CELEBORN holds a DAGGER out the ARAGORN. ARAGORN  takes the dagger and unsheathes it. It is a beautiful, yet \\ndeadly work of art. \\n      CELEBORN \\n   (Elvish; subtitled) \\n  Le aphadar aen.  \\n  You are being tracked. \\n \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN replaces the dagger in its sheath. \\n       CELEBORN \\n  By river you have the chance of  \\n  outrunning the enemy to the Falls of    Rauros. \\n \\nEXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK - DAWN  \\nThe FELLOWSHIP are in three small ELVEN BOATS. ELVES quietly \\nwatch them depart.  \\n \\nCLOSE ON: LEGOLAS, remembering...  \\n     GALADRIEL (V.O.) \\n  My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of    the Galadhrim. Worthy of the skill of  \\n  our woodland kin. \\n INSERT FLASHBACK \\n \\nANGLE ON: LEGOLAS lifts an elegant BOW and tests its strength.   \\nANGLE ON: GALADRIEL smiles and walks to MERRY and PIPPIN. \\n \\nANGLE ON: MERRY removes a dagger from its sheathe and gazes upon \\nit.   \\n \\n      (CONTINUED) 151. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n     GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D)   These are the daggers of the Noldorin.  \\n  They have already seen service in war.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: PIPPIN looks upon his gift with the fear he may have \\nto use it. He casts his eyes upon GALADRIEL.  \\n     GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D) \\n  Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.    You will find your courage. \\n \\nEND FLASHBACK  \\nCLOSE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN ride expressionless in their boat. \\n CLOSE ON: SAM, remembering... \\n \\n     GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D) \\n  And for you, Samwise Gamgee, Elven \\n  rope made of hithlain.  \\nINSERT FLASHBACK \\n ANGLE ON: SAM bows to her, accepting his gift. \\n \\n     SAM   Thank you, my lady. \\n \\nHe looks at MERRY and PIPPIN, and then back to GALADRIEL. \\n \\n     SAM    (hesitantly) \\n  Have you run out of those nice, shiny  \\n  daggers?  \\nGALADRIEL smiles, and SAM holds onto his rope, embarrassed. She \\nmoves on to GIMLI, who stares at the ground in her presence.  \\n     GALADRIEL \\n  And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the    Elves? \\n \\nANGLE ON: GIMLI shakes his head quickly. \\n \\n     GIMLI   Nothing.  \\n \\nHe looks up at her.  \\n      (CONTINUED) 152. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\n     GIMLI (CONT’D)   Except to look upon the lady of the \\n  Galadhrim one last time for she is  \\n  more fair than all the jewels beneath  \\n  the earth. \\n ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL laughs. GIMLI scowls at his foolishness and \\nturns away. He recovers and turns back to her. \\n      GIMLI (CONT’D) \\n  Actually... There was one thing. No,  \\n  no, I couldn’t. It’s quite impossible.    Stupid to ask. \\n \\nEND FLASHBACK  \\nCLOSE ON: GIMLI rides silently before LEGOLAS. He closes his \\neyes, allowing the memory to flood into his head.  \\n \\nCLOSE ON: ARAGORN, remembering...  \\nINSERT FLASHBACK \\n ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL stands before ARAGORN. \\n \\n     GALADRIEL   I have nothing greater to give than  \\n  the gift you already bear. \\n \\nCLOSE ON: She touches the EVENSTAR PENDANT ARAGORN wears. \\n       GALADRIEL (CONT’D) \\n   (in Elvish; subtitled) \\n  Am meleth dîn.

You have  \\n  your own choice to make, Aragorn.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN straightens before her. \\n      GALADRIEL (CONT’D) \\n  To rise above the height of all your  \\n  fathers since the days of Elendil or to    fall into darkness with all that is  \\n  left of your kin. \\n Silence follows ... branches shake ... a spider web’s  \\nglimmering strands sway in the wind.  \\n ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL glances at the pendant, and smiles. \\n \\n  GALADRIEL (CONT’D) \\n  (in Elvish; subtitled) \\n  Namárië.   \\n  Farewell. \\n ANGLE ON: ARAGORN bows to her and turns to leave.

In his head, FRODO still hears her voice... \\n \\n     GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D)   May it be a light for you in dark  \\n  places, when all other lights go out. \\n CLOSE ON: GIMLI riding at the head of his boat, paddled by \\nLEGOLAS. \\n      GIMLI \\n  I have taken my worst wound at this \\n  parting having looked my last upon \\n  that which is fairest. Henceforth I \\n  will call nothing fair unless it be \\n  her gift to me. \\n \\n     LEGOLAS   What was her gift? \\n \\n     GIMLI   I asked her for one hair from her \\n  golden head. She gave me three. \\n \\nCLOSE ON: LEGOLAS smiles. \\n EXT. RIVER ANDUIN - DAY \\n \\nThe boats pass into the GREAT RIVER ANDUIN. The THREE ELVEN boats carry the FELLOWSHIP steadily southward. GREEN TREES \\nslowly give way to a brown and withered land. \\n EXT. FOREST - DAY \\n \\nThe URUK forces are running through the trees with deadly purpose. \\n \\nEXT. RIVER ANDUIN - DAY \\n \\nA flock of birds circle high above, BLACK against the PALE SKY. ARAGORN watches them with concern. \\n 155. \\n \\n EXT. RIVER ANDUIN BANKS - NIGHT \\n \\nThe THREE BOATS are safely stored on the bank out of the water.   \\nANGLE ON: BOROMIR hides behind a rock watching the river.  \\n \\nCLOSE ON: A LOG floats down the river. A HAND grasps the log and \\npulls itself onto it. Who or whatever it is seems to be trying to remain concealed from the eyes of the FELLOWSHIP. \\n \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN approaches from behind BOROMIR.  \\n     ARAGORN \\n  Gollum. He has tracked us since    Moria. \\n \\nGOLLUM’S POV: GOLLUM watches the BOROMIR and ARAGORN stand behind the ROCK.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: The log runs into a rock on the opposite side of the \\nriver and stops. \\n      ARAGORN (O.S.) \\n  I had hoped we would lose him on  \\n  the river.  \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN and BOROMIR continue watching GOLLUM. \\n      ARAGORN (CONT’D) \\n  But he’s too clever a waterman. \\n \\n     BOROMIR \\n  And if he alerts the enemy to our    whereabouts, it will make the  \\n  crossing even more dangerous. \\n ANGLE ON: FRODO listens to the exchange between ARAGORN and \\nBOROMIR. He looks worried. \\n      SAM (O.S.) \\n  Have some food, Mr. Frodo. \\n      FRODO \\n  No, Sam. \\n \\n     SAM \\n  You haven’t eaten anything all day.    You’re not sleeping, neither. Don’t  \\n  think I haven’t noticed. \\n       (CONTINUED) 156. \\n \\n ANGLE ON: SAM moves from the campfire to sit with FRODO. \\n \\n     SAM   Mr. Frodo- \\n \\n     FRODO \\n  I’m all right. \\n      SAM \\n  But you’re not. I’m here to help you.  \\n  I promised Gandalf that I would.  \\nCLOSE ON: FRODO looks at SAM, sadly, with the full weight of the \\nknowledge of what he must do.  \\n     FRODO \\n  You can’t help me, Sam. Not this time.    Get some sleep. \\n \\nFRODO turns away from SAM and returns to his own thoughts. \\nReluctantly, SAM concedes and leaves FRODO alone. \\n ANGLE ON: BOROMIR turns away from the rock to ARAGORN. \\n \\n     BOROMIR   Minas Tirith is the safer road. You  \\n  know that. From there we can regroup.  \\n  Strike out for Mordor from a place    of strength. \\n \\n     ARAGORN \\n  There is no strength in Gondor that  \\n  can avail us.  \\n     BOROMIR \\n  You were quick enough to trust the    Elves. \\n \\nARAGORN doesn’t respond, but listens impatiently.  \\n     BOROMIR (CONT’D) \\n   (desperately)   Have you so little faith in your own  \\n  people? Yes, there is weakness. There  \\n  is frailty. But there is courage also,  \\n  and honor to be found in Men. But you  \\n  will not see that.   \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns away from BOROMIR. BOROMIR grabs \\nARAGORN’S tunic, and turns ARAGORN to him.  \\n      (CONTINUED) 157. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\n     BOROMIR (CONT’D)   You are afraid! \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO listens intently to BOROMIR arguing with \\nARAGORN. \\n      BOROMIR (O.S.) (CONT’D) \\n  All your life, you have hidden in  \\n  the shadows.  \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN calmly listens to BOROMIR’S ravings.  \\n      BOROMIR (CONT’D) \\n  Scared of who you are, of what  \\n  you are.   \\nARAGORN adjusts his tunic and turns away from BOROMIR. BOROMIR \\nis speechless. ARAGORN turns back to him. \\n \\n     ARAGORN   I will not lead the Ring within a  \\n  hundred leagues of your city. \\n       CUT TO: \\n \\nEXT. RIVER ANDUIN - DAY  \\nANGLE ON: BOROMIR, still feeling the defeat from the previous \\nevening, paddles down the river along with the rest of the \\nFELLOWSHIP. He glances scathingly towards ARAGORN.  \\n ANGLE ON: ARAGORN refuses to return his glance. \\n \\nEXT. PILLARS OF THE KINGS, RIVER ANDUIN - DAY  \\nThe THREE ELVEN boats drift slowly through the steep rocky gorge \\nin the PRE-DAWN light.   \\nCLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly paddling in the stern. \\n      ARAGORN \\n   (quietly) \\n  Frodo.  \\n \\nFRODO slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement.   \\n \\n      (CONTINUED) 158. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nWIDE ON: TWO ENORMOUS ROCK STATUES, towering like 300 foot pinnacles on either side of the river ... carved images of \\nGONDORIAN KINGS of old. They loom over the boats with power and \\nmajesty. \\n \\n     ARAGORN (CONT’D)   The Argonath... \\n \\nCLOSE ON: ARAGORN ... strangely moved by the beauty of the silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself. \\n \\n     ARAGORN (CONT’D)   Long have I desired to look upon the  \\n  kings of old ... my kin. \\n The FELLOWSHIP stare in stunned silence as the current takes \\nthem through the narrow gap at the STATUES’ feet. \\n \\nWIDE ON: CRANING UP past the statues vast crumbling heads, to \\nREVEAL a LARGE LAKE only a mile down river...  \\nEXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL - DAY \\n ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP as they leap out of the boats and \\nclamber onto the wooded shore. \\n      ARAGORN \\n  We cross the lake at nightfall, hide  \\n  the boats and continue on foot ... we  \\n  approach Mordor from the North. \\n      GIMLI \\n   (gloomy) \\n  Oh, yes, just a simple matter of    finding our way through Emyn Muil, an  \\n  impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp  \\n  rocks. And after that, it gets even    better ... a festering, stinking  \\n  marshland as far as the eye can see. \\n      ARAGORN \\n  That is our road. I suggest you take  \\n  some rest and recover your strength,  \\n  Master Dwarf. \\n      GIMLI \\n   (indignant) \\n  Recover my...  \\n      (CONTINUED) 159. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nANGLE ON: LEGOLAS turns to ARAGORN with urgency.  \\n     LEGOLAS \\n  We should leave now. \\n \\n     ARAGORN   No. Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We  \\n  must wait for cover of darkness. \\n      LEGOLAS \\n  It is not the Eastern shore that    \\n  worries me.   \\nLEGOLAS casts a glance around into the PARTH GALEN forest... \\n      LEGOLAS \\n  A shadow and a threat has been growing  \\n  in my mind. Something draws near, I can  \\n  feel it. \\n ARAGORN looks at LEGOLAS, knowing full well what he means. \\n \\nANGLE ON: SAM has slumped asleep. MERRY dumps a small pile of kindling at GIMLI’S feet.... \\n \\n     MERRY   Where’s Frodo? \\n \\nSAM sits up with a start ... ARAGORN’S head snaps around. His \\neyes fly to BOROMIR’S shield which lies abandoned by his camp \\nbed.   \\nCLOSE ON: ARAGORN ... as he realizes BOROMIR has gone! \\n EXT. SLOPES OF AMON HEN - DAY \\n \\nFRODO is walking beneath the trees ... lost in thought. His feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab ... his eyes follow \\nan overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the SUMMIT OF \\nAMON HEN ... the seeing seat.   \\nA CRACKLING SOUND! FRODO freezes... \\n \\n     BOROMIR \\n   (quietly)   None of us should wander alone; you  \\n  least of all. So much depends on you   \\n  ... Frodo?   \\n      (CONTINUED) 160. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO turns slowly ... he stares at BOROMIR, tense, cautious. \\n \\n     BOROMIR \\n  I know why you seek solitude. You  \\n  suffer, I see it day by day. Are you    sure you do not suffer needlessly?  \\n \\nFRODO stands silent for a moment ... the murmur of the WIND in the trees and the distant roar of the FALLS OF RAUROS can be \\nheard. \\n      BOROMIR \\n  Let me help you. There are other ways,  \\n  Frodo ... other paths that we might    take. \\n \\n     FRODO \\n  I know what you would say, and it would  \\n  sound like wisdom but for the warning    of my heart. \\n \\n     BOROMIR   Warning? Against what?  \\n \\nBOROMIR has started forward towards FRODO. FRODO backs away from him. \\n \\n     BOROMIR (CONT’D) \\n  We’re all afraid, Frodo. But to let  \\n  that fear drive us to destroy what hope    we have ... don't you see that is  \\n  madness? \\n      FRODO \\n  There is no other way. \\n      BOROMIR \\n  I ask only for the strength to defend  \\n  my people.    (angrily drops the wood he  \\n    has collected) \\n  If you would but lend me the Ring... \\n \\n     FRODO   No... \\n \\nFRODO steps hurriedly away from BOROMIR.  \\n      (CONTINUED) 161. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\n     BOROMIR   Why do you recoil? I am no thief. \\n \\n     FRODO \\n   (wary) \\n  You are not yourself.  \\n     BOROMIR \\n  What chance do you think you have? They    will find you, they will take the Ring  \\n  and you will beg for death before the  \\n  end.  \\nFRODO turns to leave. \\n      BOROMIR (CONT’D) \\n  You fool! It is not yours, save by  \\n  unhappy chance. It might have been  \\n  mine! It should be mine! Give it to me!  \\n  Give me the Ring.  \\nBOROMIR leaps on top of FRODO, grasping for the RING! FRODO has \\nonly moments to act. FRODO rips the RING from around his neck ... and rams it on his finger. \\n \\nFRODO DISAPPEARS.   \\nBOROMIR spins wildly around, yelling into thin air! \\n \\n     BOROMIR \\n  I see your mind ... you will take the    Ring to Sauron. You will betray us!  \\n  You go to your death and the death of  \\n  us all! Curse you! Curse you and all    your Halflings! \\n \\nBOROMIR stumbles and falls. His body shakes as if in the THROES of a fit ... slowly, he comes to. \\n \\n     BOROMIR (CONT’D)    (disoriented) \\n  Frodo! Frodo! What have I done? Please,  \\n  Frodo... \\n 162. \\n \\n EXT. SEEING SEAT - DAY \\n \\nIN THE TWILIGHT WORLD: FRODO races through the misty Twilight world, past the foggy shapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind \\nhim, Boromir’s distraught voice carries, as if from another \\ndimension. \\n \\n     BOROMIR (O.S.)   I’m sorry, Frodo ... Frodo... \\n \\nFRODO suddenly finds himself on the stone steps ... he clambers up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone pillars. \\nFRODO cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the throne of \\nmountain kings. The world of mist swirls around him.   \\nFRODO peers out from the seat ... the world seems to shrink. In \\nall directions, VIEWS of far off lands TELESCOPE towards him through the mist. \\n \\nIMAGES: ORCS spilling out of holes in the MISTY MOUNTAINS ... \\nFLAMES rise from MIRKWOOD ... Grim faced EASTERLINGS march to \\nwar ... BLACK SHIPS sail to the South. All the power of the Dark Lord is in motion.  \\n \\nFRODO moves his gaze to the East ... FIRE explodes against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills Frodo’s vision. \\nA mountain of iron, immeasurably strong, tower of adamant: \\nBARAD-DÛR, the fortress of SAURON.  \\nSUDDENLY! SAURON’S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF \\nLIGHT. \\n \\n     SAURON (V.O.)    (IN BLACK SPEECH) \\n  They will fall! \\n ANGLE ON: FRODO leaps off the seat, and tumbles down the stairs! \\nThe EYE sweeps AMON HEN like a searchlight, seeking its RING! \\nWith a huge effort, FRODO wrenches the RING off his finger...  \\nEXT. SUMMIT OF AMON HEN - DAY \\n FRODO lies gasping on the SUMMIT OF AMON HEN ... below the \\nancient ruins of the seeing seat.  \\n \\nAT THAT MOMENT: A BLACK BOOT STEPS INTO SHOT! \\n FRODO looks up as ARAGORN towers over him. \\n \\n     ARAGORN   Frodo? \\n \\n      (CONTINUED) 163. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n     FRODO    (numb) \\n  It has taken Boromir. \\n \\nARAGORN moves towards FRODO... \\n      ARAGORN \\n   (urgent) \\n  Where is the Ring?  \\nFRODO backs away from ARAGORN ... ARAGORN is shocked by the \\nmovement.  \\n     FRODO \\n  Stay away!  \\n     ARAGORN \\n  Frodo ... I swore to protect you.  \\n \\n     FRODO   Can you protect me from yourself?  \\n \\nCLOSE ON: FRODO uncurls his fist ... in his palm lies the RING!  It glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun ... ARAGORN’S \\neyes are drawn to it. \\n      FRODO (CONT’D) \\n  Would you destroy it? \\n \\n     THE RING \\n  Aragorn. Aragorn. Elessar.  \\n     ARAGORN \\n   (kneeling to Frodo)   I would have gone with you to the end \\n  ... into the very fires of Mordor. \\n      FRODO \\n  I know. Look after the others, especially  \\n  Sam ... he will not understand.  \\nARAGORN FREEZES! He draws his sword. \\n \\n     ARAGORN \\n   (urgent)   Go, Frodo! \\n \\nFRODO hesitates.  \\n      (CONTINUED) 164. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\n     ARAGORN    (yells) \\n  Run. Run! \\n \\nFRODO backs away into the trees... \\n ANGLE ON: ...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto AMON HEN behind ARAGORN! \\n \\nARAGORN attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman ... he brings two down with his sword leaping into the ruins as others close \\nin on him.  \\n ANGLE ON: FRODO scrambles down the HILLSIDE, away from the \\nfight. \\n ANGLE ON: ARAGORN battles the URUK-HAI, amongst the pillars and \\nblocks of AMON HEN. Despite his bravery, he is quickly \\nsurrounded. \\n \\nSUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into the URUK-HAI. LEGOLAS races out of the woods, firing his bow. GIMLI leaps into the battle, \\nwielding his mighty axe. \\n EXT. PARTH GALEN HILLSIDE - DAY \\n \\nFRODO is darting down the steep hillside as heavy feet thunder down after him. \\n \\n     SAM \\n  Mr. Frodo! \\n ANGLE ON: SAM looks around for FRODO. \\n \\nCLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his URUKS.  \\n     LURTZ \\n  Find the Halflings ... find the    Halflings! \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO stumbles and falls ... quickly he crawls behind a tree ... above him the sound of URUK-HAI crashing through the \\nforest rings out. \\n \\n     MERRY (O.S.) \\n   (urgent whisper)   Frodo! \\n \\nFRODO turns to see MERRY and PIPPIN hiding in a hollow, a few feet away. \\n \\n       (CONTINUED) 165. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\n      MERRY (CONT’D)    Hide here, quick! \\n \\n      PIPPIN \\n  Come on! \\n ANGLE ON: FRODO looks at his friends ... slowly shakes his head, \\na great sadness in his eyes.  \\n      PIPPIN (CONT’D) \\n  What's he doing? \\n ANGLE ON: MERRY’S eyes meets FRODO’S. Understanding. \\n \\n     MERRY    (softly) \\n  He's leaving. \\n \\n     PIPPIN \\n  No!  \\nPIPPIN stands and makes a move toward FRODO .. MERRY grabs at \\nhis arm.  \\n     MERRY \\n  Pippin!  \\nANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN look up the slope where a cry has \\nrings out. THEY HAVE BEEN SEEN! \\n \\n     MERRY    (to Frodo) \\n  Run, Frodo. Go on! \\n MERRY waves his arms at the approaching ORCS. \\n \\n     MERRY   Hey, hey you! Over here!  \\n \\n     PIPPIN   Hey! \\n \\n     MERRY \\n  Over here! \\n      PIPPIN \\n  This way! \\n       (CONTINUED) 166. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\nMERRY and PIPPIN run, leading a pack of ORCS.   \\nANGLE ON: FRODO runs to the lake. \\n \\nANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN, still running from the ORCS \\n      PIPPIN \\n  It's working! \\n      MERRY \\n  I know it's working! Run! \\n MERRY and PIPPIN stop ... more URUK-HAI approach from the other \\ndirection ... THEY ARE TRAPPED. \\n SUDDENLY! BOROMIR charges up the hillside and blocks the stroke \\nof the leading URUK-HAI.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: THE ECHO OF BOROMIR’S HORN reaches ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, \\nand GIMLI ... they are battling their way down the SLOPES towards the lake. \\n \\n     LEGOLAS   The horn of Gondor! \\n \\n     ARAGORN   Boromir! \\n \\nARAGORN desperately slashes his way towards BOROMIR, felling \\nURUK-HAI in his path ... while LEGOLAS and GIMLI fight a REAR \\nGUARD ACTION.  \\nANGLE ON: Many URUK-HAI fall to BOROMIR’S sword as he tries to \\nprotect MERRY and PIPPIN...  \\n     BOROMIR \\n  Run! Run!  \\nANGLE ON: LURTZ takes aim. \\n ANGLE ON: A BLACK ARROW suddenly THUDS into BOROMIR’S chest. \\nAmazingly, BOROMIR continues fighting, but another arrow ... and \\nanother, brings him to his knees. \\n \\nANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI. \\n \\n       (CONTINUED) 167. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (3) \\n \\n     MERRY & PIPPIN   Aaaaagh! Boromir! Boromir! \\n \\nANGLE ON: LURTZ aims his bow at BOROMIR’S heart ... suddenly \\nARAGORN charges at him, smashing the BOW with his sword. They \\nlock into a deadly battle.   \\nANGLE ON: ARAGORN cuts LURTZ down and races towards BOROMIR, who \\nlies slumped against a tree ... URUK-HAI arrows sticking out of his chest. \\n \\nAt least 20 dead URUK-HAI lie heaped around BOROMIR. His horn lies at his feet ... CLOVEN in two. \\n \\n     BOROMIR    (painful gasp) \\n  They took the little ones... \\n \\nARAGORN quickly tries to staunch the flow of BLOOD from \\nBOROMIR’S shoulder.  \\n     BOROMIR (CONT’D) \\n   (panicked)   Frodo ... where is Frodo? \\n \\n     ARAGORN   I let Frodo go. \\n \\nBOROMIR holds Aragorn’s gaze. \\n \\n     BOROMIR   Then you did what I could not. I tried  \\n  to take the Ring from him. \\n      ARAGORN \\n  The Ring is beyond our reach now. \\n      BOROMIR \\n  Forgive me. I did not see ... I have  \\n  failed you all.  \\n     ARAGORN \\n  No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You  \\n  have kept your honor. \\n ARAGORN tries to bind BOROMIR’S wound. \\n \\n       (CONTINUED) 168. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (4) \\n \\n     BOROMIR   Leave it! It is over ... the world of  \\n  Men will fall and all will come to  \\n  darkness and my city to ruin ...  \\n  Aragorn...   \\n      ARAGORN \\n  I do not know what strength is in my  \\n  blood, but I swear to you ... I will    not let the White City fall, nor your  \\n  people fail... \\n      BOROMIR \\n  Our people ... our people... \\n ARAGORN places BOROMIR’S sword in his hand. BOROMIR’S fingers \\ntighten around the hilt. \\n \\n     BOROMIR (CONT’D) \\n  I would have followed you, my brother    \\n  ... my captain, my king. \\n \\nARAGORN lays BOROMIR down. He is dead.  \\n     ARAGORN \\n  Be at peace, son of Gondor.   \\nARAGORN bends and KISSES BOROMIR’S forehead.  \\n \\nLEGOLAS and GIMLI appear behind him ... ARAGORN stands. \\n      ARAGORN (CONT’D) \\n  They will look for his coming from the  \\n  White Tower ... but he will not return.  \\nEXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL - DAY \\n On the lakeshore, FRODO stands in front of one of the ELVISH \\nboats, the RING in his palm.  \\n ANGLE ON: A distraught SAM ... running as hard as he can through \\nthe forest... \\n \\n     SAM \\n  Mr. Frodo!  \\n \\n      (CONTINUED) 169. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nCLOSE ON: FRODO looks to the far side of the river ... the CAMERA moves in on the RING. \\n \\n     FRODO (V.O.) \\n  I wish the Ring had never come to me. I  \\n  wish none of this had happened...  \\nTears fall down FRODO’S face... \\n      GANDALF (V.O.) \\n  So do all who live to see such times...  \\n  but that is not for them to decide. All    we have to decide is what to do with  \\n  the time that is given us. \\n With renewed determination, FRODO tucks the RING inside his vest \\npocket.  \\n \\nANGLE ON: The small figure of FRODO pushing the ELVISH boat into \\nthe water...  \\nANGLE ON: SAM bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake \\n... FRODO is already paddling away.  \\n     SAM \\n   (anguished)   Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo!  \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO, in the boat, paddling steadfastly away from the \\nshore ... tears in his eyes ... the voice of SAM carried on the \\nwind. FRODO whispers to himself.  \\n     FRODO \\n  No, Sam.  \\nANGLE ON: SAM looks at the water ... then at the boat.  \\n SPLASH! FRODO turns to see SAM launching himself into the water. \\n \\n     FRODO   Go back, Sam! I'm going to Mordor alone. \\n \\nANGLE ON: SAM splashes hopelessly toward the boat. \\n \\n     SAM   Of course you are ... and I'm coming  \\n  with you! \\n       (CONTINUED) 170. \\n \\n CONTINUED: (2) \\n \\n     FRODO   You can't swim. \\n \\nSAM starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...  \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO drops his paddle and scramble backwards in the boat... \\n \\n     FRODO (CONT’D)    (frightened) \\n  Sam! \\n ANGLE ON: SAM is underwater ... hands flailing helplessly as he \\nsinks. \\n CLOSE ON: FRODO’S hand grasping SAM’S... \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO pulls a bedraggled and half-drowned SAM into the \\nboat. FRODO and SAM look at each other, out of breath, tears and \\nwater streaming down both their faces.    \\n     SAM \\n  I made a promise, Mr. Frodo ... a    promise. \\n   (fierce passion) \\n  “Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee.”    (sobs) \\n  And I don't mean to ... I don't  \\n  mean to. \\n \\n     FRODO    (crying) \\n  Oh, Sam! \\n FRODO starts to laugh through his tears ... the two friends hug.  \\n \\n     FRODO (CONT’D)   Come on then... \\n \\nThe two HOBBITS row through the water...  \\nEXT. FALLS OF RAUROS AERIAL - DAY \\n \\nSLOW MOTION: Looking down on swiftly flowing water ... BOROMIR’S \\nbody slides under CAMERA.  \\nHe is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his chest ... \\nhis broken horn at his side.   \\n      (CONTINUED) 171. \\n \\n CONTINUED:  \\n \\nSUDDENLY... the boat drops away from CAMERA ... as it plunges over the massive FALLS OF RAUROS, disappearing into the vapor \\nbelow. \\n \\nEXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL - DAY \\n ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS pushes the last boat into the water. \\n \\n     LEGOLAS   If we are quick, we will catch Frodo \\n  and Sam before nightfall. \\n ARAGORN looks toward the far shore: FRODO and SAM’S small boat \\ncan be seen lying on the distant RIVERBANK as FRODO and SAM make \\noff into the forest beyond. He doesn’t react.   \\nANGLE ON: LEGOLAS turns and looks at ARAGORN. \\n \\n     LEGOLAS (CONT’D) \\n  You mean not to follow them...  \\n     ARAGORN \\n  Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.  \\n     GIMLI \\n  Then it has all been in vain ... the    Fellowship has failed. \\n \\n     ARAGORN \\n  Not if we hold true to each other. We  \\n  will not abandon Merry and Pippin to    torment and death, not while we have  \\n  strength left.  \\n ARAGORN pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it on. \\n \\n     ARAGORN   Leave all that can be spared behind.  \\n \\nCLOSE ON: ARAGORN ... a steely light in his eye.  \\n     ARAGORN (CONT’D) \\n   (grimly) \\n  We travel light. Let’s hunt some Orc.  \\n      GIMLI \\n  Yes! Ha! \\n       (CONTINUED) 172. \\n \\n CONTINUED: \\n \\nARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI disappear into the WOODS, following the URUK-HAI trail. \\n \\nEXT. EMYN MUIL HILLTOP - DAY \\n \\nFRODO and SAM scramble onto a high ridge.  \\nWIDE ON: A distant line of SAW TOOTHED mountains below a dark, \\noppressive sky. Black volcanic smoke rises behind the mountains ... MORDOR! \\n \\nANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM look with grim determination.  \\n     FRODO \\n  Mordor! I hope the others find a safer    road. \\n \\n     SAM \\n   (simply) \\n  Strider’ll look after them.  \\n     FRODO \\n  I don't suppose we'll ever see them    again. \\n \\n     SAM   We may yet, Mr. Frodo. We may. \\n \\n     FRODO \\n  Sam? \\n FRODO looks at SAM with great affection ... despite the grim \\noutlook, SAM is undeterred... \\n      FRODO (CONT’D) \\n  I'm glad you're with me. \\n WIDE ON: THE TWO HOBBITS SETTING OFF TOWARD MORDOR. \\n \\nTO BE CONTINUED...  \\n \""

However, solidification cracking and additional embrittling features at grain boundaries have resulted in poorly performing microstructures, stymying the application of AM as a manufacturing technique for W. Several alloying strategies , such as ceramic particles and ductile elements,  have  emerged with the promise  to eliminate solidification cracking while simultaneously enhancing stability against recrystallization.  In this work, we provide new insights regarding the defects and microstructural features that result from the introduction  of ZrC for grain refinement and NiFe as a ductile reinforcement phase – in addition to the resulting thermo physical and mechanical properties . ZrC is shown to promote microstructural stability with increased hardness  due to the formation of ZrO 2 dispersoids . Conversely, NiFe form s into micron -scale FCC phase region s within a BCC  W matrix , produc ing enhanced toughness relative to pure AM W. A combination of these effects  is realized in the WNiFe+ZrC system and  demonstrates  that complex chemical environm ents coupled with the tuning of AM microstructures  provides an effective pathway for enabling laser AM W materials with enhanced stability and performance .  Keywords: Tungsten; tungsten heavy alloy; additive manufacturing; microstructure   1  1. Introduction  Refractory metals (tungsten , molybdenum, tantalum, rhenium, etc.)  have attractive properties for applications  in extreme operating environments  containing high thermal and radiation fluxes  such as those experienced by plasma -facing materials in  existing and  future fusion energy devices  [1-3]. While tungsten ( W) has emerged as the leading candidate in planned fusion demonstrations [4], it continues to suffer from a high ductile -brittle transition temperature  (DBTT)  and can be further embrittled  by exposure to irradiation  [5-9]. These issues  undermine  its effectiveness by reducing  machinability and limit ing operation  temperature . Furthermore , W recrystallizes at intermediate  elevated temperatures  (i.e., 1100 -1300 °C depending on material grade) , leading to a reduction in the high temperature strength  [10], and raising the DBTT  [11]. Alloying  of W has been shown to alter the impurity distribution in the W matrix , which is  often correlated with ductility  and recrystallization resistance. S everal different approaches have led to enhanced performance metrics relative to pure W, and some of these improvements offer distinct benefits for mitigating crack formation in additively manufactured W -based materials.   Recent work on W-Re and W-K alloys  have demonstrated marked improvements in  low and high temperature performance, respectively. W-Re alloys , from 1 -25 at.% Re [12],  lower the DBTT , increase  both toughness and ductility  [13], and have  limited  recrystallization [14]. K-doped W, typically employed in high temperature applications, relies on the formation of  nanoscale K bubbles to kinetically pin W grains during high temperature operation , thereby preventing grain growth to preserv e the W microstructure [15-17] and limit ing creep [18]. Some oxide and carbide dispersion -strengthened materials have also demonstrated  enhanced thermal stability due to the same mechanisms, but interesting ly with increased ductility at fusion -relevant temperatures [19-26]. With these approaches relying  on the kinetic  pinning of grain boundaries  (rather than alternative thermodynamic approaches [27-29]), it is intrinsically limited at high homologous temperatures due to the Arrhenius temperature dependence of the grain boundary mobility [30].  Other approaches to alloying W instead utilize elements  that phase separate from W and form a ductile matrix. This class of materials  is often referred to as tungsten heavy alloy s and generally  contain  additions of Ni, Fe, Co, and/or Cu  in concentrations that maintain  W as the solvent . At alloying concentrations of up to ~10 wt.% , improved sinterability  and ductility  [31] have been reported , albeit with  a reduced  density and recrystallization temperature [32, 33] . As 2  with many of the afore mentioned alloys , heavy alloy  synthesis has largely focused on conventional processing methods (arc melting or sintering ), which  require long duration exposure to high temperature s and result in coarse -grained samples  and inherent constraints on fabricating complex shapes without  significant  post-processing.  Additive manufacturing (AM) encapsulates a relatively new class of  energy -beam  fabrication techniques  [34, 35] , which  allow for near -net shape material fabrication  and direct process control pathways  while eliminat ing post-fabrication material working . Due to limitations in hot forging geometries, AM techniques  such as  Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L -PBF) , have been recently employed to produce W parts with complex geometries  [36-40]. However, AM W is riddled with cracks due to the  affinity of W to form embrittling features at grain boundaries upon solidification  (e.g., oxides and pores) , repeated heating and cooling through its DBTT during AM, and large  thermal expansion strains  [41, 42] . Crack formation is attributed to hot cracking, an umbrella term from welding to describe cracks that form at elevated temperatures  [42, 43] . While typically associated with solidification, the driving force is defined as shrinkage strains between grains  [44, 45]  with tungsten being  particularly susceptible due to its low fracture toughness and high DBTT (~723 K). On this basis, Vrancken et al.  [42, 46]  employed  in situ high-speed video to demonstrate  that part heating above the DBTT can eliminate cracking in tungsten plates and rods, but conclude d that this strategy has limited effectiveness in AM processing due to enhanced impurity diffusion in high surface area powders . Other strategies from the welding community center on reducing these shrinkage strains by altering the melt pool shape, reducing impurities, and/or grain size refinement.    Owing to these issues, AM of W alloys have been investigated  [37, 47] , with several  W-Ta [48] and W -ZrC [49] alloys exhibit ing reduced cracking  relative to commercially pure AM W. Ivekovič  et al. [50] considered a commercial W heavy alloy ( W-7Ni-3Fe, wt. %) , hypothesizing that these elements will increase the temperature over which solidification occurs  and enabl e the liquid to accommodate grain shrinkage . They also examined s ubsequent heat treatments to liquify the NiFe  phase, which fill ed existing cracks  and led to ductility in tension [50].  Unlike the AM W-Re alloys, where cracks in solidified components can only be healed after two high temperature heat treatments – one under a hydrogen atmosphere at 2400 °C and the other under a pressure of 200 MPa at 2000 °C [51] – these heat treatments can be carried out at much lower temperatures and for shorter times. Alloying therefore  represents a promising pathway for the elimination of 3  processing -induced cracking in AM tungsten . However, there are several outstanding questions regarding the interplay between elemental constituents, their concentration, and the resulting microstructure during solidification.   In this study , we examine  microstructures in AM W  alloys, fabricated v ia L-PBF, with the alloying additions chosen based on their potential to reduce/ mitigate solidification crack formation. Specifically, ZrC is added to W to refine the microstructure during solidification , while a ductile FCC NiFe phase is explored as a toughening element to help accommodate  large thermal strains. Combined effects of these two alloying additions are also considered in the multicomponent WNiFe +ZrC system. Microstructure an d phase distribution in each alloy are characterized through electron microscopy and multimodal  X-ray analysis methods . Our results provide definitive proof that carbide dispersions reduce crack density via grain refinement , while NiFe  additions effectively backfill solidification cracks but at the expensive of mass loss via vaporization, which enhances the retained porosity.  In addition, the FCC NiFe phase is shown to be integrated into the W grain structure unlike traditional heavy W  alloys where it serves as a matrix between primary W particles.  These resulting microstructures provide insights into the scaling of hardness and thermal  properties  with alloy composition and subsequent thermal aging.  2. Materials and Methods  Four alloys were considered in this study: W, W+0.5ZrC, W-3.5Ni -1.5Fe , and W-3.5Ni -1.5Fe+0.5ZrC . W powders  (-325 mesh) were acquired from Global Tungsten & Powders , Ni and Fe powders ( -325 mesh) were acquired from Fisher Scientific , and 20 nm ZrC nanopowders were acquired from US -Nano.  Ni and Fe powders were added  to W via mechanical tumbling for 3 -8 hours, and ZrC was introduced via high -energy ball milling  for 1 -2 hours . The heavy alloy  composition is more W -rich than the study by Iveković et al.  [50] but should still  take advantage of the large  solidification range afforded by Ni+Fe . The small fraction of ZrC was chosen to both act as an oxygen getter and a grain refiner during solidification.  Cylindrical s pecimens , 12.5mm in diameter and 10 mm in height,  were printed  on steel build plate s using a commercial EOS L-PBF machine . In this study, the goal was not to optimize laser processing parameters but rather have samples built under similar conditions for comparison. A range of volumetric energy densities was considered  following the work in Iveković ] et al. [50], where energy densities between 175 -200 Jmm-3 provided sufficiently dense specimens across all 4  four compositions.  The densities determined via the Archimedes method were as follows: W (15.7 gcm-3), W+0.5ZrC (14.8 gcm-3), W-3.5Ni -1.5Fe  (16.5 gcm-3), and W-3.5Ni -1.5Fe +0.5ZrC  (16.2 gcm-3). Cylin ders were  cut via electrical discharge machined , 2.0 mm above the build plate , to avoid chemical mixing. Samples were later sectioned into thin disks ~1 mm in height for thermal property characterization and hardness testing. Using a Netzsch 467HT L aser Flash Analyzer  (LFA)  apparatus, thermal diffusivity  was determined  from room temperature to 1 000 °C in 200  °C increments on bulk cylindrical samples with diameters of 12.5 mm and thicknesses of 2 mm. A graphite standard reference was used to determine the thermal conductivity.  Vickers indentation was performed  using a 500 gf load  with reported hardness values determined from a minimum of 10 indents per sample.   A JEOL  IT300 scanning electron microscop e (SEM) operat ing at 30 kV was used for  SEM energy -dispersive X -ray spectroscopy  (SEM -EDS ) elemental mapping to establish bulk composition distribution and locations for transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  sample fabrication.  An EDAX Octane Elite Super EDS detector  and EDAX Velocity Super electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) camera  coupled to the IT300 SEM was used for SEM -EDS and SEM -EBSD mapping, respectively . Samples for TEM were prepared through a typical  focused ion beam (FIB) milling and lift -out procedure using a Scios 2 DualBeam SEM -FIB operated with a Ga beam at 30 keV with final cleaning  steps  at 5 and 2 keV . The I3TEM at Sandia National Laboratories , a JEOL 2100 TEM operated at 200 kV,  was used for bright -field TEM (BF-TEM) imaging. Automated Crystallographic Orientation Mapping (ACOM) was performed on the JEOL 2100 using the Nanomegas ASTAR analysis software. A n 11 nm step size and 10  cm camera length were utilized to collect the diffraction patterns as the beam was rastered across the TEM samples. The Topspin Software (Nano megas  SPRL) package was used to collect the diffraction patterns with matching of the collected diffraction patterns to the correct phase accomplished using the Index2 software (Nanomegas SPRL) package . Further clean -up of the ACOM data was processed via TEAM software  (Ametek, Inc.) , performing a nearest neighbor confidence index and orientation clean up recipes that changed <5% of the index ed data points.  Further microstructural characterization via STEM -EDS was carried out with an FEI Talos F200X  located in the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) .  Two-dimensional scanning X-ray spectroscopy measurements were performed at the Hard X-Ray Nanoprobe (HXN) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source -II (NSLS -II) to 5  extract elemental [52] and chemical  [53, 54]  information on the microstructural features observed in these systems. The incident X-rays had a wavelength of 1.3776\\u2009Å (9\\u2009keV ) and were focused via a Fresnel zoneplate nanofocusing optic s to a ~40\\u2009×\\u200940\\u2009nm spot size employing scanning dwell times of 20 -100\\u2009ms. The samples examined in  this study were TEM lamellas of nominally 100 nm thickness. Nanoscale X-ray absorption near -edge spectroscopy (nano -XANES) [53] around the Fe and Ni K-edge s (7112 and 8333 eV, respectively) were performed to resolve the local  atomic  structure within the different phase regions determined through STEM -EDS with a spatial resolution of 40 nm. Two -dimensional X-ray florescence (XRF) spectral maps (60 and 72 individual maps for Fe and Ni K -edges, respectively) were processed and visualized in PyXRF [55] and MIDAS  [56]. Full-field X -ray computed tomography  (XCT)  data sets were collected for a series of specimens, employing a Zeiss Xradia 520 Versa X -ray microscope. The X -ray source was operated at 140kV and 71.6 μA (10W). The isotropic voxel size was set to 1.1 µm and a series of 800 projections were collected ov er 360° with a 10 s image collection time per step. Data reconstruction was performed using a filtered -back projection algorithm  and visualized in ImageJ.  Bulk samples for the ex situ XRD annealing study were subjected to heat treatments at 1150 and 1350  °C for 5 hrs  under a reducing gas atmosphere ( Varigon H5, 95% Ar and 5% H) in an MTI GSL -1600X tube furnace. XRD measurements were performed at the X -ray Powder Diffraction (XPD) beamline at NSLS -II. All measurements were performed in transmission mode with an amorphous silicon -based flat panel detector (Perkin -Elmer) mounted orthogonal to , and centered on , the beam path. The sample -to-detector distance and tilts of the detector relative to the beam were refined using a CeO 2 (SRM 674b) powder standard. The wavelength o f the incident X-rays was 0.1839 Å at 67.40 keV. The sample -to-detector distance was calculated to be 133 .56 cm. Multiple patterns were acquired  to ensure collection of isotropic diffraction rings  with a ll raw two -dimensional (2D) XRD patterns background corrected by subtracting the dark current image and Kapton/air scattering. Noticeable artifacts in the 2D images (beam stop or dead pixels) were masked. The corrected and masked two -dimensional detector i mages were then averaged and radially integrated to obtain the one-dimensional  XRD patterns.  The background subtracted XRD patterns were analyzed with the TOPAS software package (BRUKER)  using a modified pseudo -Voigt function  for fitting of the peak profiles . The instrument contribution to the broadening of the measured profiles was quantified by fitting a CeO 2 6  NIST powder standard, with known crystalline -domain size and negligible strain contribution. The Gaussian and Lorentzian -based broadening parameters were subsequently fixed during the analysis of the alloys under investigation. The weight fraction, coherent domain  size, lattice parameter, and microstrain for the body -centered cubic (BCC)  W matrix phase were allowed to vary during the refinements. The microstrain components for the minor  face-centered cubic  (FCC ) NiFeW phase (present in WNiFe and WNiFe +ZrC) were not included in the refinements due to the known complications associated with  their quantification at such small sizes (the refined size parameters of the FCC phase  are thus lower limits).   3. Results  3.1. Microstructure and Morphology  X-ray computed tomography  was performed to determine the extent of porosity and cracking formed during processing; representative slices through the three -dimensional volumes of each microstructure are shown in Figure 1. Extensive cracking is observed in pure W, as expected for  AM W microstructures  [41]. The addition of ZrC reduced crack formation in the microstructure; however, a higher number of pores are observed compared to pure W. Extensive porosity is observed in both W heavy alloy microstructures, with a higher degree of porosity in WNiFe relative to WNiFe+ZrC. The XCT results in Figure 1 show  that alloy ing can reduce cracking at the expense of  increasing  porosity , but the latter can be more easily addressed through process optimization and/or heat treatment [57].  However, the combination of the NiFe alloying additions with ZrC particles  collectively mitigate d cracking while reducing the degree of porosity.  7   Figure 1. X-ray computed tomography slices through 3D volumes of as-printed  AM (a) W, (b) W+ZrC, (c) WNiFe, and (d) WNiFe+ZrC. Cracking in the AM W  and W+ZrC is eliminated in the WNiFe and WNiFe+ZrC samples but at the expense of porosity.   Low magnification SEM micrographs of the  sample microstructures and corresponding elemental composition maps are shown in Figure 2 for the commercially pure W and alloys of W+ZrC, WNiFe, and WNiFe+ZrC . Macroscale cracking  (indicated by the black arrows)  and pores  (indicated by the white arrows)  are evident on the surface of the W and W+ZrC samples. Porosity is evident in the ternary heavy W alloy (both WNiFe and WNiFe+ZrC), in addition to  spherical W-rich regions  (indicative of unmelted W powder particles ) and a secondary phase at the W interfaces. SEM -EDS maps of the secondary phase reveal that they are predominantly composed of Ni and Fe. Furthermore, the distribution of Zr varies significantly betwee n W+ZrC and WNiFe+ZrC ; in the W+ZrC sample, Zr appears to segregate into 1 -10 µm particles at W grain boundaries while in the WNiFe+ZrC sample, it is homogeneously distributed.  8  Figure 2. Secondary electron SEM micrographs and corresponding SEM -EDS elemental maps for samples: (a) W  (No EDS mapping given the absence of alloying elements) , (b) W+ZrC, (c) WNiFe, and (d) WNiFe+ZrC. Porosity is evident in the samples (indicated with white arrows), while cracking is evident in the W+ZrC sample (indica ted with black arrows). The WNiFe and WNiFe+ZrC samples have NiFe -rich regions, appearing in black, distributed intergranularly between W grains, including some spherical  unmelted W grains.  The crystallographic orientations for each microstructure are shown in Figure 3, through  out-of-plane EBSD inverse pole figure ( IPF-Z) maps of grains indexed as BCC  W. Pure W exhibits  a typical AM solidification  microstructure , where  grain topologies follow melt-pool boundaries  [41]. However, t he microstructure changes drastically with the addition of the second ary phase elements. ZrC  (Figure 3b) refines the grain  structure  from tens of micrometer s for pure W to ultra-fine grain  sizes  in W+ZrC. At these temperatures, ZrC will melt and either restricts the grain size during solidification or via Zener pinning – or a combination of both  [58-61]. The addition of NiFe produces  a heterogeneous  grain microstructur e with more equiaxed grains that are varied in size . Some spherical W grains are  observed  (similarly to the SEM micrographs in Figure 2), indicative  of unmelted W powder particles. Finally, the WNiFe+ZrC sample demonstrates substantial  texturing , on a scale of  tens of micrometer s, with ultra-fine grains .  9   Figure 3. EBSD IPF-Z maps of the grain structure of as-printed  AM (a) W, (b) W+ZrC, (c) WNiFe, and (d) WNiFe+ZrC . STEM high -angle annular dark -field (STEM -HAADF) micrographs of the l ocal microstructure for  the W and W+ZrC  samples are provided in Figure 4. The W lamella  (Figure 4a) consist ed primarily  of a single grain, with a grain boundary evident at the bottom right of the lamella. The W+ZrC sample  under STEM -HAADF  imaging conditions ( Figure 4b) consist ed of the W matrix  (region  with lighter contrast ) and a Zr dispersoid (region with darker contrast ), consistent with  the SEM -EDS map in Figure 2b. The Zr dispersoid is approximately  1 µm wide and has a sharp  interface with the W matrix ; this dispersoid  likely contains twins , evidenced by the numerous parallel lines and corresponding contrast features in Figure 4b. STEM -EDS maps  reveal W-rich and Zr -rich regions, with the Zr -rich region containing  appreciable O-content. There is no evidence of ZrC, which is  not surprising because cubic ZrO 2 twins easily and ZrC may be decomposed into Zr and C during the AM fabrication process , at which point the Zr readily oxidize s into ZrO 2.  10   Figure 4. STEM -HAADF  micrographs  of as -printed (a) W and (b) W+ZrC with STEM -EDS maps of W, Zr, C, and O acquired on  a region containing a grain boundary in the W+ZrC  sample.  STEM -HAADF images f or the WNiFe sample  are shown in in Figure 5a. The large variations in the enhanced Z -contrast suggest ive of a two -phase microstructure  [62] with a dendritic component as observed in Figure 2c.  The lighter phase is  consistent with a predominantly W matrix while the second phase  is significantly darker  in contrast  and rich in the lighter elements  (i.e., Ni and Fe ).  These regions are found  primarily between W grains  and are < 500 nm in size with sharp  interfaces and free of porosity.  STEM -EDS maps indicate a correspondence between Ni and Fe in the se second phase regions , denoted as NiFeW for the remainder of this text , with a total concentration of 45 at.% W, 39 at.% Ni, and 16 at.% Fe (compared to the BCC W region containing 98 at.% W, 1 at.% Ni, and 1 at.% Fe).  The IPF -Z ACOM map is also shown, indexed for BCC W  (red)  and FCC Ni  (green)  grains , and confirm s the presence of a two -phase microstructure as suggested by the STEM -HAADF /EDS analysis . The WNiFe+ZrC sample  also exhibited NiFe W-rich regions  distributed within a W-rich matrix as evidenced by the Z -contrast in the STEM -HAADF image in Figure 5b and confirmed in the EDS maps.  These NiFe W regions are  akin to those in the ternary alloy and nominally  200 nm wide. However, a significantly larger number of interfaces was found in the WNiFe+ZrC sample , which is  attributed to the addition of ZrC promoting the formation of a finer microstructure  during solidification  (Figure 3).  The STEM -EDS maps also reveal the affinity for Zr to occupy the FCC NiFe W phase, but with a subtle gradient into the BCC W phase especially around the phase boundaries.  Finally, the ACOM map  in the inset confirmed the two -phase microstructure, 11  which relative to the WNiFe sample free of Zr, exhibited a more defined FCC NiFe W phase with structurally sharp interfaces despite the grading of Zr across the phase boundaries.     Figure 5. STEM -HAADF  micrographs  and STEM -EDS maps (W, Ni, Fe, and Zr) of as -printed (a) WNiFe and (b) WNiFe+ZrC.  ACOM phase maps are provided as insets.  3.2. Phase and Electronic Structure  For the samples containing NiFe additions, nano -XANES measurements were conducted around the Fe and Ni K -edges (7112 and 8333 eV, respectively) to “fingerprint”  the local structure within the different phase regions . Results for the WNiFe  specimen  are shown in Figure 6 with the 2D XRF maps at both K -edges shown in the insets reveal ing the two-phase microstructure including the bulk W region  (mapped in blue)  containing low concentrations of Ni and Fe and secondary region with high concentrations of Ni and Fe  (mapped in green/yellow) , consistent with  the STEM -EDS maps in Figure 5a. Examination of the XANES spectra collected at the Ni K -edge (Figure 6a) shows evidence of two features: (i) the NiFe W phase  (black  spectrum collected from the region indicated with a black square ) is predominately FCC, as no notable difference is present when compared with the FCC Ni standard (blue  spectrum ), and  (ii) the bulk region (red  spectrum from the region indicated with a red square ) corresponds to a BCC W phase with a trace concentration of interstitial Ni atoms. Relative to the FCC Ni standard, the  XANES spectra of the Ni atoms within the  bulk W -phase  exhibited a reduced pre -edge feature  (~8340 eV ), a more pronounced post -edge peak  (8351eV ), and additional  multiple scattering  peak s at 8365 and 8370 eV. At the Fe K -edge in Figure 6b, the XANES spectra attributed to the FCC NiFeW  phase (black) is consistent with the spectra observed at the Ni K -edge. The XANES spectra for the Fe atoms 12  within the bulk BCC W phase (red) matches the BCC Fe standard (blue) closely at the pre -edge feature and exhibits a similar post -edge peak and an additional peak at 7160 eV.   Figure 6. XANES spectra from selected regions in  AM WNiFe at the (a) Ni K -edge (8333 eV) and (b) Fe K -edge (7112 eV). Composite 2D XRF maps are provided as insets with  the corresponding  XANES spectra from the identified regions matching the respective colors denoting the measurement locations.  FCC Ni and BCC Fe XANES standards are provided for reference  [63]. Differences in the shape and intensity of features around the K -edge are linked to the electronic structure and atomic environment of the absorbing and neighboring atoms [64, 65] . For example,  prominent features  in the Ni and Fe XANES regions result directly from multiple scattering resonances of the 1 s photoelectron in the continuum [66, 67] . The differences in the Fe and Ni K -edge spectra quantified from the W matrix and NiFeW regions demonstrate clearly the different atomic environments. Specifically, substitutional Ni and Fe atoms are present within the 13  W BCC matrix while the NiFeW segregated regions exhibit an FCC crystal structure aligned with the Ni standard . Similar results are observed in the XANES spectra collected at both Ni and Fe K -edges for the WNiFe+ZrC sample in Figure 7. The inset XRF maps reveal two distinct phases with the  BCC W phase  exhibiting th e reduced pre -edge feature and identical features in the post -edge region (shown in red). The second phase  corresponds to FCC NiFe W, with a noticeably large pre-edge feature and four peaks in the post -edge region (shown in black)  at 8352, 8359, 8362, and 8381 eV . The 2D XRF maps and XANES results indicate that the addition of the ZrC does not significantly influence the microstructural phase of the other two components despite the difference in Zr distribution from in  the STEM -EDS maps .   Figure 7. XANES spectra from selected regions in AM WNiFe+ZrC  at the (a) Ni K -edge (8333 eV) and (b) Fe K -edge (7112 eV). Composite 2D XRF maps are provided as insets with the corresponding XANES spectra from the identified regions matching the respective colors denoting the measurement locations. FCC Ni and BCC Fe XANES standards are provided for reference  [63]. 14  Synchrotron XRD patterns for the as-printed  W and W alloy samples are shown in Figure 8 with crystallographic indices corresponding to BCC W and FCC Ni indexed where appropriate .  The unalloyed W exhibited only BCC W , as expected , which was also the dominant phase in the W+ZrC sample .  Given the twinning apparent  in the Zr-rich phase of the W+ZrC  microstructure  (as shown in  Figure 4b), it is likely that the corresponding Zr phase peak is too broad and weak to be distinguished from the background .  The XRD patterns acquired on the WNiFe and WNiFe+ZrC sample s exhibited peaks corresponding to a secondary FCC  Ni phase  in addition to the primary BCC W phase.  F rom the nano -XANES maps in Figure 6 and Figure 7, these peaks derive from the NiFeW inclusions without the appearance of any additional Zr-based  phases , consistent with Zr being dissolved in the FCC NiFeW solid solution from Figure 5b.   Figure 8. XRD data of all as-printed  bulk AM samples  with BCC W phases indexed with a square  and FCC phases with a circle . Lattice parameter, coherent domain size, microstrain, and phase fractions quantified from the XRD patterns are provided in Table 1. Lattice parameters across all the printed samples are reduced relative to typical values for BCC W, e.g., 3.165 Å [68] with smaller contractions (~.005 15  Å) in W and W+ZrC and larger contractions (~.01 Å) in WNiFe and WNiFe+ZrC , a likely reflection of alloying in the BCC W phase The larger lattice parameter for the FCC NiFeW phase is in agreement with the STEM -EDS maps suggesting that small amounts of W are dissolved into the FCC lattice and consistent with previous observations in other W heavy alloys [69-71]. The increas ed compositional complexity also manifested in the microstructural features accessible from XRD, specifically the microstrain and coherent domain size  also captured in Table 1.   Table 1. Lattice parameter, X -ray coherent scattering domain size, microstrain, and phase fraction s as determined via XRD for the as-printed  bulk AM W samples.  Sample Composition  Phase  Lattice Parameter  (Å) Coherent Domain  Size (nm)  Microstrain  (A.U.)  Phase Fraction  (wt. %) W BCC W  3.16047  ± 0.00006  654.0 ± 76.0 0.010  ± 0.001  - W+0.5ZrC  BCC W  3.16162  ± 0.0000 4 96.4 ± 3.5 0.023  ± 0.001  - W-3.5Ni -1.5Fe  BCC W  3.15541  ± 0.00006  59.1 ± 1.2 0.029  ± 0.002  96.2 FCC Ni  3.60980  ± 0.000 48 20.8 ± 1.0 - 3.7 W-3.5Ni -1.5Fe +0.5ZrC  BCC W  3.15604  ± 0.0000 5 57.4 ± 1.0 0.044  ± 0.002  97.2 FCC Ni  3.60875  ± 0.000 88 16.5 ± 1.0 - 2.8  The microstrain was nominally low in pure W with a large coherent domain size, consistent with the general lack of cellular dislocation networks in laser AM W  due to the low thermal expansion of W , as the primary source of dislocations in AM metals is generally attributed to plastic deformation induced by thermal expansion/shrinkage in a constrained medium  [72]. The alloys all exhibited greater  microstrain relative to pure W, with comparable increases upon the addition of ZrC and NiFe to 0. 023 and 0. 029, respectively. Combining these two alloying additions in the WNiFe+ZrC samples produced a further increase in the microstrain relative to the ternary alloys to 0.044, indicating that the microstructures became increasingly strained in the presence of more complex alloying environments  due to the increased solute concentrations  in the bulk BCC W phase  and increased  grain boundary densities [73]. Accompanying this change in microstrain with added solute concentrations (especially relative to the unalloyed W sample) were reductions 16  in the coherent domain sizes, where the addition of ZrC dropped this length scale relative to pure W with a further decrease for the WNiFe alloy but with little additional change upon the addition of ZrC to this ternary. Collectively, the finer coherent scattering sizes and concomitant increases in microstrain indicate that the addition of solute element s produced more complex crystalline microstructures containing a higher degree of defects. We note that the coherent domain size determined from XRD does no t reflect the actual grain sizes of the samples, as the presence of higher order defects has been shown to significantly reduce coherent scattering especially in AM materials [54, 74] . 3.3. Thermal Stability and Thermophysical Properties   Thermal stability was investigated at two  temperatures  of 1150 °C and 1350 °C, selected based on common recrystallization temperatures for tungsten  [75] and analyzed via ex situ  XRD  to capture the evolution of atomic and microstructural parameters. XRD patterns  (not shown)  for the annealed samples appeared qualitatively identical to the  patterns for the corresponding as-printed condition in Figure 8 with Rietveld refinements employed to  extract subtle changes in peak positions and the ir degree of broadening .  Microstrain was quantified for the primary BCC W phase with relative phase fractions considering the FCC NiFeW phase , and results are s hown in Figure 9. Relaxation of the microstructure manifested as a reduction in the microstrain during annealing in Figure 9a with W and WNiFe  exhibiting a monotonic decrease  as a function of annealing temperature  with terminal average values of 0.005 and 0.020 at 1350  °C, respectively. The W+ZrC sample also exhibited microstructural relaxation , but with a large reduction upon annealing at 1150 °C and only a  little additional change following the 1350  °C heat treatment . Conversely , the microstrain remained approximately constant , within error,  for the WNiFe+ZrC sample . Accompanying the stability exhibited by this sample was a consistent phase distribution through annealing, where the fraction of the FCC NiFeW phase remained at approximately 3 wt. % from Figure 9b.  The fraction of the FCC NiFeW phase in the WNiFe sample also remained constant at approximately 3.7% regardless of the annealing temperature .   17   Figure 9. (a) Microstrain and (b) phase fraction  for all AM W microstructures in the as -printed and annealing conditions.  For the BCC W phase , in all specimens, values for the lattice parameter  determined through a Rietveld refinement  shown in Figure 10a were contracted relative to typical values for W ( e.g., 3.165 Å). Annealing of the microstructures resulted in minor expansions of the lattice parameters: in W and W+ZrC the lattice parameter increased by nominally 0.04%, while in WNiFe and WNiFe+ZrC the lattice parameter increased by approximately 0.2%. Furthe rmore, the increase in the lattice parameter of BCC W in the heavy ternary alloys coincide d with a substantial contraction in the lattice parameter of FCC NiFeW , as shown in Figure 10b, of nominally 0.5%. Thus, while relaxation of the microstructures is evident across all samples, this behavior is exacerbated in the heavy ternary alloys due to contraction of the secondary FCC NiFeW phase , which is attributed to  the diffusion of Fe from the FCC NiFeW phase into the BCC W phase.   Figure 10. Lattice parameter for all  (a) BCC and (b) FCC AM W phases  in the as -printed  and annealing conditions. Literature values for the lattice parameter of BCC W, FCC Ni, and FCC Fe from [76]. 18  The following behavior can be inferred from the XRD trends through annealing. First, in pure W, the absence of solute -rich heterogeneities eliminates such barriers to defect motion, and the reduction in microstrain is therefore a consequence of increased d efect recovery  at elevated temperature. Second, solute redistribution is not expected to occur in W+ZrC with temperature as Zr exists as ZrO 2. Instead, the refined grain sizes in W+ZrC allow for the rapid annihilation of 2D defects (e.g., dislocations, sta cking faults, twins) at elevated temperature with no subsequent change in microstructure due to stabilization forces from the oxide dispersoids following the Zener pinning effect [77]. Third, solute distributions in the W heavy alloys contribute to higher lattice strains in the BCC W phase that are captured in the increased microstrain. In WNiFe, microstructural relaxation occurs during annealing following solute redistribution and concomitant enhanced mobility of the as -printed defects, which manifests as a gradual and continuous decrease in the microstrain with increasing temperature. Finally, in the case of WNiFe+ZrC, the addition of Zr in the b ulk suppresses defect mobility relative  to the ternary alloys, thereby stabilizing as -printed defects across the annealing temperatures considered in this study. It follows that microstructural  stability in the printed alloys is a consequence of the increased number of obstacles to dislocation motion, which is directly connected to the increased microstructural complexity generated through alloying.  Given the minimal microstructural changes occurring above 1150°C, thermophysical properties were mapped at temperatures of up to 1000  °C to extract the  thermal conductivity of the alloys relative to the printed pure W sample . Thermal conductivity, 𝜆, was determined for each sample from the specific heat, 𝐶𝑝, and thermal diffusivity, 𝛼, using the expression:    𝜆=𝜌𝐶𝑝𝛼, (1) where 𝜌 is the measured density . Thermal conductivity as a function of temperature is provided in Figure 11a for the W and W+ZrC samples relative to reference values for W [78].  Immediately evident are the significantly reduced thermal conductivities exhibited by the printed W and W+ZrC relative to the literature values for pure W. In the printed W, the disparity is due to the difference in microstructure and reduced density ty pical of AM materials. Furthermore, the addition of ZrC only served to further reduce thermal  conductivity due to the presence of ZrO 2 dispersoids.     19   Figure 11. Thermal conductivity as a function of temperature for (a) W and W +ZrC, and (b) W niFe and W niFe+ZrC samples .  Given the solute redistribution determined from XRD analysis, the samples in (b) were heated twice, with thermal conductivity measured up to  200 °C for the second run. Thermal conductivity of pure W [78] and D185 W -2Ni-1Fe [79] are provided  for reference.  Thermal conductivity , and its scaling with temperature , for the WNiFe and WNiFe+ZrC alloys are shown in Figure 11b relative to values for a reference ternary D185 W -2Ni-1Fe alloy [79]. The trends were identical within measurement error for both samples  with lower values relative to the r eference WNiFe  alloy  below 600 °C and higher values above 600 °C.  These alloys also aligned closely with the W+ZrC sample at temperatures up to 200 °C but diverged to larger values above this temperature. The absence of a plateau value for the AM W NiFe  samples indicates  that the microstructural changes through annealing were reflected in the scaling of the thermophysical properties  with temperature . Samples from both WNiFe and WNiFe+ZrC were reheated to 200 °C following the initial heating cycle used to produce the trends in Figure 11.  Trends up to this temperature f or the second heating cycle  provided in Figure 11b demonstrate that annealed  WNiFe exhibited increased thermal conductivities relative to the as -printed values .  Conversely, the thermal conductivity for WNiFe+ZrC did not exhibit any noticeable changes, 20  signaling that the addition of ZrC promoted microstructural stability and is in agreement with the consistent microstrain values through annealing of this sample . 3.4. Insights into Alloying Effects on Mechanical Behavior  Given the range of alloy  chemistries and microstructural changes through annealing, the dependence of the mechanical properties on these factors was evaluated using indentation experiments . The indentation technique was deliberately selected to map the changes in hardness collectively with the implied toughness of the samples , where for brittle materials, microcracks generally form in lieu of residual pile -up from localized plasticity [80]. Vickers indents were performed on each sample in the as -printed condition and following annealing to 1150 and 1350 °C with results shown in Figure 12. The average  Vickers hardness for the as -printed W  sample was 420 HV, consistent with prior hardness measurements on AM W [57, 81] , with the addition of ZrC increas ing it  to 460 HV due to the presence of the ZrO 2 precipitates . The hardness of the as -printed WNiFe alloy was higher  at 530 HV , despite the formation of the FCC NiFe W second phase , and  is attributed to solid solution strengthening in both the BCC and FCC phases .  Finally, the addition of ZrC to the WNiFe ternary further enhanced the hardness to 595 HV, which is due to solid solution strengthening of Zr homogeneously distributed in both FCC and BCC phases  consistent with the STEM -EDS maps in Figure 5b. Representative  surface morphologies around the residual impressions were also imaged for the as -printed samples and are shown in Figure 12(b-e). Both the W and W+ZrC samples exhibited clear evidence of microcracking , but with a reduced number of cracks generally observed around the residual impressions  for W+ZrC.  N evertheless, any degree of cracking indicates that both the W and W+ZrC samples are brittle  in the as -printed state , which agrees with reported indentation results on W [82]. Conversely, the periphery of the residual impressions produced on the WNiFe and WNiFe+ZrC samples were free of microcracking with evidence of pile-up on the surface of the WNiFe sample that appeared to align with the underlying dendritic microstructur e in Figure 12d. These findings suggest an enhanced toughness  in the  as-printed  WNiFe and WNiFe+ZrC samples  relative to W and W+ZrC . 21   Figure 12. (a) Vickers hardness for all AM  W microstructures in the as -printed condition and annealed at the indicated temperatures. Optical micrographs of representative impressions on the as-printed samples of (b) W, (c) W+ZrC, (d) WNiFe, and (e) WNiFe+ZrC. Shared scalebar for all images provided in (d).  Annealing led to reductions in the hardness across all samples but with differing temperature dependencies and overall degrees of softening. In W and W+ZrC, the decrease  in hardness was minimal, decreasing to 415 and 440 HV  after annealing at 1150 °C , respectively. However, the increase in annealing temperature to 1350 °C produced a marked decrease in the hardness for W to 390 HV while W+ZrC exhibited only a minor decrease relative to the 1150 °C condition .  Given the temperature and time, the onset of recr ystallization is expected in W and consistent with th is decrease in hardness [83], thereby suggesting that the addition of ZrC – and subsequent decomposition to form ZrO 2 following laser AM – stabilize d the alloy against recrystallization.  22  In the WNiFe  microstructures, annealing produced  significant and continuous reductions in the hardness , with the WNiFe alloy converging to the value for W while the WNiFe+ZrC sample approached the hardness of the W+ZrC sample.  Unlike the W+ZrC s ample, the decomposition  of ZrC in the  WNiFe  ternary promoted Zr incorporation in both the BCC and FCC solid solution s rather than the formation  of ZrO 2, thereby eliminating the oxide -induced stabilization mechanism exhibited by the W+ZrC alloy .  Furthermore, the initial drop in hardness following the 1150 °C anneal aligns with the changes in the lattice parameter in Figure 10b, signaling that the changes in the degree of solid solution strengthening in each phase was responsible for softening over this temperature range.  However, at 1350 °C, the lattice parameter plateaued, demonstrating that the additional reduction in hardne ss was not due to further solute redistribution but likely the onset of recrystallization in these alloys.  Therefore, while the more complex alloys exhibited enhanced hardness and toughness due to the combination of solid solution strengthening and the presence of a more ductile FCC phase, temperature -induced microstructural instabilities lead to  a precipitous reduction in strength relative to the as -printed condition with the upper temperature limit of the alloys inevitably constrained by the low melting point FCC NiFeW phase.   4. Discussion  Three unique additively manufactured W  alloy  microstructures were fabricated and characterized in this study  with comparisons drawn to a pure AM W sample contain ing large  (≥1 μm) irregular  grain s with melt -pool tracks  and extensive microcracking in the as -printed state . The AM W prepared in this work exhibited a Vickers hardness ( 420 HV), which is  comparable to typical polycrystalline W (400 -450 HV [84]) and greater than recrystallized W (300 HV) [33], but with a high density of microcracks found in the periphery of the residual impressions as previously observed during indentation experiments on severely -deformed W [82]. Annealing at temperatures known to recrystallize deformed grades of tungsten [83] led to reductions in the hardness to below 400 HV  (an approximately 10% reduction in hardness) , indicating  the W microstructure  recrystallized above 1150 °C. The AM W sample also exhibited non -negligible reductions in thermal conductivity, with a value of 100 W/m∙K at room temperature compared with ~164 W/m∙K  for polycrystalline W  [78]. This behavior reflects  the high crack density in the AM sample [85], shown  in the XCT image of the microstructure shown in Figure 1a.   23  The first of the alloys – W+ZrC – exhibited  fine grain sizes (≤1 μm)  with the ZrC decompos ing to form  a distribution of ZrO 2 dispersoids with a smaller (i.e., down to 50 nm) population distributed within the W matrix and a larger ( ≥1 μm ) population concentrated at interfaces.  Interestingly, build tracks and the larger grain sizes reported by Li et al . [49] in AM W+ZrC were not immediately evident in this microstructure .  The finer grain structure and coarse ZrO 2 dispersoids at interfaces  more  closely resembled spark plasma -sintered  (SPS)  W+ZrC composites  [21], but with an additional population of small sub micrometer  oxides distributed within the W matrix  – likely due to the fast solidification rate .  The W+ZrC sample  in this study combine s attributes common to both AM and SPS W+ZrC microstructures, exhibiting a bimodal size distribution of ZrO 2 dispersoids with a finer grain micro structure.  Solidification cracking was retained in this alloy despite the effective reduction in grain size and consistent with the distribution of ZrO 2 throughout the microstructure.  Comparatively , the second alloy – WNiFe – also e xhibited fined grain sizes (≤1 μm) but with an equiaxed microstructure containing two phase regions of BCC W and FCC NiFeW. This microstructure diverged  from conventionally -sintered WNiFe heavy alloys, which commonly contain a  spherically -shaped W matrix with a NiFe -rich binder phase interweaving between matrix particles  [69, 86] . While some spherical BCC W particles are observed and attributed  to ineffective melting during deposition  [87], the FCC NiFe W region s are smaller, more dispersed, and persist both inter - and intra -granularly. The presence of this ductile NiFeW  phase eliminated microcracking but produced a high degree of retained porosity.  The third alloy merged the strategy of adding ZrC to refine the microstructure with the introduction of a ductile FCC NiFe W phase in the multicomponent WNiFe+ZrC  system.  The as -printed alloy exhibited refined grain sizes (≤1 μm) within  a two -phase BCC W and FCC NiFeW  microstructure but with substantial texturing at the micrometer -scale . This microstructure is reminiscent of a traditionally processed WNiFe heavy alloy , which consists of  a NiFe -rich binder region intermixed with  elongated W regions  [69, 88] . However, the TEM lift -out shown in Figure 5 was deliberately extracted  from a region containing the NiFe W phase , and Figure 2 shows larger regions of pure W containing  W-W grain boundaries exist in the alloy that are not commonly observed  in liquid phase sintered WNiFe heavy alloys. Unlike the W+ZrC  alloy , where the ZrC additive decomposed to form  ZrO 2 dispersoids, the addition of ZrC  to the WNiFe ternary led to a nearly homogeneous distribution of Zr in the resulting  microstructure – albeit  with a slight 24  preference for Zr to  occupy the BCC W matrix. This behavior is confirmed by comparing the XANES data collected at the Ni K -edge in WNiFe ( Figure 6a) and WNiFe+ZrC ( Figure 7a), where the subtle reductions in the edge peak and shifts in the post -edge peaks in the BCC W spectr a indicated that Zr occupies substitutional sites in the W BCC solid solution , but not at a high enough concentration to significantly alter the XANES spectra. The refined grain structure, absence of brittle ZrO 2 dispersoids, and presence of a ductile NiFeW phase eliminate d solidification cracking while reducing the degree of retained porosity relative to the ternary WNiFe alloy .   The Vickers hardness of the AM W+ZrC ( 460 HV) was comparable to  W+ZrC produced through deformation processing routes such as cold -rolled W+ (1 wt.% )ZrC (510 HV) [24].  Conversely, lower density sintered W+(0.5-1 wt.% )ZrC exhibited a reduced average hardness in the range of  225-300 HV [21]. The increase in hardness relative to pure W is a reflection of the decreased grain size and the presence of ZrO 2 nanodispersoids, which serve to decrease dislocation mobility and consequently increase the hardness through the well -established Orowan strengthening mechanism [89]. Furthermore, the microstructure exhibited brittle behavior through indentation, as expected for the addition of a brittle ceramic to an already brittle metallic material.  Annealing the W+ZrC microstructure showed little reduction in the average hardness, decreasing only to ~435 HV at 1350 °C (a 6% drop) , and consistent with the minimal change in the coherent domain size  from XRD.  Microstructural stability in this system is a reflection of the reduction in grain boundary motion due to Zener pinning arising  from the presence of ZrO 2 particles [90]. Furthermore, the addition of ZrC served to decrease the overall thermophysical properties of the composite , reducing the thermal conductivity ( Figure 11c) at room temperature from nominally 100 W/m ×K in pure W  to 60 W/m ×K. While the addition of a ceramic is expected to reduce thermal conductivity, t his value is significantly lower than the  cold-rolled W+ 1.0wt.% ZrC (150 W/m ×K) [24] but aligns with the reduction in pure W  due to the presence of microstructural heterogeneities inherent to the AM solidification process .  The hardness of 530 HV for the ternary WNiFe alloy was on the upper end of the spectrum exhibited by other typical W heavy alloys from literature, which ranges from 310 HV to 540 HV in the case of liquid phase sintered WNiFeCo  [91, 92] , and greater than nominally 490 HV as demonstrated by other SLM AM W NiFe microstructures [93]. The presence of the FCC NiFeW phase also produced a more ductile indentation response relative to pure W and the W+ZrC 25  sample, consistent with prior reports on ductile phase -toughened W alloys [94]. Annealing led to  a significant reduction in hardness  due to relaxation  (of approximately 30% in both alloys) , as evidenced by the increase in the BCC W lattice parameter, concurrent decrease in the FCC NiFeW lattice parameter, and reduction in the microstrain . In the WNiFe +ZrC system, the introduction of Zr as a substitutional element in both the BCC W and FCC NiFeW phases manifested as a 12% increase in hardness relative to WNiFe. Typically, such an increase in hardness due to the addition of a substitutional element would be attributed primarily to solid solution strengthening ; however, prior work on Zr -doped W heavy alloys have suggested that grain refinement is the primary driver of mechanical hardening in these alloys [95, 96] .  The EBSD maps in Figure 3 indeed  indicate  that the addition of ZrC refined the microstructure , but consistenc ies in the coherent domain sizes  across the different alloys  suggest additional mechanisms  contribute to the hardening beyond  simpl e grain refinement.  The addition of Zr instead stabilized 2D defects as reflected by the increase  in microstrain val ues in Figure 9, which accounts for the increased hardness exhibited by the WNiFe +ZrC alloy in both the as -printed and annealed conditions.  Directly comparing the hardness of the alloys containing the ductile NiFeW phase with either the pure W or the W+ZrC sample is difficult since microcracking in the latter two samples serve as an en ergy dissipation mechanism that would otherwise contribute to further plastic deformation, thereby artificially increasing the reported hardness of these samples.  Finally, the identical scaling of the thermal conductivit y with temperature for these alloy s indicates  that Zr in solid solution had little effect on thermal conductivity . However, the redistribution of Fe via diffusion from the NiFeW phase  at elevated temperature, as inferred from  the change in lattice parameter in  Figure 10, increased the thermal conductivity via a composite effect [97, 98]  by reducing the degree of alloying in the NiFeW phase . 5. Conclusions  The microstructural and thermo physical impact of two distinct  alloying  strategies , and their combination,  for AM W was explored : ZrC additive s to refine the microstructure during solidification , and a ductile FCC NiFe phase to increase toughness and  accommodate large thermal strains.  While SEM, TEM, and  multimodal  X-ray characterization demonstrated  appreciable variation s in the microstructural characteristics of the as -printed samples, in general, the effect of 26  ZrC or NiFe was confirmed to substantially  reduce the crack density relative to  as-printed commercially pure W, with the following system specific findings : • ZrC additions to the powder feedstock led to ZrO 2 dispersoids, a  fine-grained micro structure, and reduced crack density in the solidified part; however, the grain refinement mechanism was not determined in this study. While ZrC additions improved the hardness relative to as -printed commercially pure W, the alloy  was brittle , whic h was confirmed by microcrack formation around the residual indentation impressions.  • The WNiFe -based alloy samples were free of solidification cracks but contained enhanced porosity due to mass loss from selective vaporization of the NiFeW phase during processing. The as -printed hardness was  improved due to a combination of solid solution and dispersion strengthening, and the ductile FCC NiFeW phase eliminated micro crack formation around indentation impressions.  Combining these alloying effects in the multicomponent WNiFe+ZrC alloy resulted in  a fine-grained micro structure  with Zr retained  in solid solution rather than forming embrittling oxides.  By eliminating the oxide  phase and introducing an intrinsically tough FCC NiFeW phase, cracking around the residual impressions was completely suppressed with increased hardness relative to the other alloys.  The thermal conductivity of all alloy  configurations  was reduced relative to AM W , as expected , and with system -dependent temperature scaling behavior that derived from the intrinsic conductivity of the given alloy chemistry or redistribution of solute at elevated temperatures. In summary, b oth alloying strategies  were shown to  reduce  solidification crack formation  with the WNiFe+ZrC alloy balancing favorable attributes from the ZrC grain refiner and NiFe toughening phase  as effective pathway s for enabling laser AM W materials with enhanced stability and performance.  6.

He lay on his armour-like back,and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domedand divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to coverit and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thincompared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.“What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream.His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefullybetween its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread outon the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it therehung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine andhoused in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat andfur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of herlower arm towards the viewer.Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of raincould be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. “Howabout if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense”, hethought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used tosleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn’t get into thatposition. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled backto where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so thathe wouldn’t have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped whenhe began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.“Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is thatI’ve chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like thistakes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of thatthere’s the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections,bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that youcan never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go toHell!” He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up onhis back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; foundwhere the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spotswhich he didn’t know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the placewith one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched ithe was overcome by a cold shudder.He slid back into his former position. “Getting up early all thetime”, he thought, “it makes you stupid. You’ve got to getenough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance,whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out thecontract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating theirbreakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out onthe spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If Ididn’t have my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice along time ago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what Ithink, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’dfall right off his desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sittingup there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard ofhearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the moneytogether to pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or sixyears I suppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do. That’swhen I’ll make the big change. First of all though, I’ve got to getup, my train leaves at five.”And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.“God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the handswere quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more likequarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed thatit had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it certainlymust have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through thatfurniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably allthe more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went atseven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and thecollection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feelparticularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would notavoid his boss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there tosee the five o’clock train go, he would have put in his report aboutGregor’s not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was theboss’s man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if hereported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as infive years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss wouldcertainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accusehis parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor’s recommendationnot to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but thatmany were workshy. And what’s more, would he have been entirely wrong inthis case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleepingfor so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get outof the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a cautious knockat the door near his head. “Gregor”, somebody called—it washis mother—“it’s quarter to seven. Didn’t you want togo somewhere?” That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard hisown voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had hadbefore. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollablesqueaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then therewas a sort of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whetherhe had heard properly or not. Gregor had wanted to give a full answer andexplain everything, but in the circumstances contented himself with saying:“Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I’m getting up now.” The changein Gregor’s voice probably could not be noticed outside through thewooden door, as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffledaway. But this short conversation made the other members of the family awarethat Gregor, against their expectations was still at home, and soon his fathercame knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist.“Gregor, Gregor”, he called, “what’s wrong?” Andafter a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice:“Gregor! Gregor!” At the other side door his sister cameplaintively: “Gregor? Aren’t you well? Do you need anything?”Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”, making aneffort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating verycarefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word. His fatherwent back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: “Gregor, open thedoor, I beg of you.” Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door,and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from histravelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home.The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed,to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only then would heconsider what to do next, as he was well aware that he would not bring histhoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed. He remembered that he hadoften felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but thathad always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginingswould slowly resolve themselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt thatthe change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself upa little and they fell off by themselves. But it became difficult after that,especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He would have used his arms andhis hands to push himself up; but instead of them he only had all those littlelegs continuously moving in different directions, and which he was moreoverunable to control. If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the firstone that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what hewanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move aboutpainfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”,Gregor said to himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of thebed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what itlooked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; andfinally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards withall the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard againstthe lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lowerpart of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,carefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily, anddespite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually followedslowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last got his head outof the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himselffall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid tocarry on pushing himself forward the same way. And he could not knock himselfout now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose consciousness.It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier, but whenhe lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as they struggledagainst each other even harder than before, if that was possible, he couldthink of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos. He told himself oncemore that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensiblething to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whateversacrifice. At the same time, though, he did not forget to remind himself thatcalm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. Attimes like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearlyas he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street wasenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offerhim. “Seven o’clock, already”, he said to himself when theclock struck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a foglike this.” And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly asif he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their realand natural state.But then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past sevenI’ll definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by thensomebody will have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me aswell, as they open up at work before seven o’clock.” And so he sethimself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bedall at the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way andkept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it. His backseemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling ontothe carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, andwhich even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm. Butit was something that had to be risked.When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new methodwas more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back andforth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody cameto help him. Two strong people—he had his father and the maid inmind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push theirarms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with theload and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor, where,hopefully, the little legs would find a use. Should he really call for helpthough, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked? Despite allthe difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought.After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hardfor him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time was now ten pastseven and he would have to make a final decision very soon. Then there was aring at the door of the flat. “That’ll be someone from work”,he said to himself, and froze very still, although his little legs only becameall the more lively as they danced around. For a moment everything remainedquiet. “They’re not opening the door”, Gregor said tohimself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of course, the maid’sfirm steps went to the door as ever and opened it. Gregor only needed to hearthe visitor’s first words of greeting and he knew who it was—thechief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to workfor a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightestshortcoming? Were all employees, every one of them, louts, was there not one ofthem who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of consciencethat he couldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least acouple of hours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough tolet one of the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were evennecessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have toshow the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chiefclerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it? And more becausethese thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision, he swanghimself with all his force out of the bed. There was a loud thump, but itwasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was softened a little by the carpet,and Gregor’s back was also more elastic than he had thought, which madethe sound muffled and not too noticeable. He had not held his head carefullyenough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it andrubbed it against the carpet.“Something’s fallen down in there”, said the chief clerk inthe room on the left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sortthat had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; youhad to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this question,the chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could nowbe heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right, Gregor’ssister whispered to him to let him know: “Gregor, the chief clerk ishere.” “Yes, I know”, said Gregor to himself; but withoutdaring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.“Gregor”, said his father now from the room to his left, “thechief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn’t leave on theearly train. We don’t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants tospeak to you personally. So please open up this door. I’m surehe’ll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.” Thenthe chief clerk called “Good morning, Mr. Samsa”. “Heisn’t well”, said his mother to the chief clerk, while his fathercontinued to speak through the door. “He isn’t well, please believeme. Why else would Gregor have missed a train! The lad only ever thinks aboutthe business. It nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in theevenings; he’s been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening.He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies traintimetables. His idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He’s madea little frame, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings,you’ll be amazed how nice it is; it’s hanging up in his room;you’ll see it as soon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I’m gladyou’re here; we wouldn’t have been able to get Gregor to open thedoor by ourselves; he’s so stubborn; and I’m sure he isn’twell, he said this morning that he is, but he isn’t.”“I’ll be there in a moment”, said Gregor slowly andthoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word of theconversation. “Well I can’t think of any other way of explainingit, Mrs. Samsa”, said the chief clerk, “I hope it’s nothingserious. But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce everbecome slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like, wesimply have to overcome it because of business considerations.”“Can the chief clerk come in to see you now then?”, asked hisfather impatiently, knocking at the door again. “No”, said Gregor.In the room on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on hisleft his sister began to cry.So why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only justgot up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she crying? Was itbecause he had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because he wasin danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once morepursue their parents with the same demands as before? There was no need toworry about things like that yet. Gregor was still there and had not theslightest intention of abandoning his family. For the time being he just laythere on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in wouldseriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minordiscourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on, itwas not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot. And it seemedto Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbinghim with talking at him and crying. But the others didn’t know what washappening, they were worried, that would excuse their behaviour.The chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa”, he called tohim, “what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no morethan yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary concernto your parents and you fail—and I mention this just by the way—youfail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of.I’m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer, andreally must request a clear and immediate explanation. I am astonished, quiteastonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now yousuddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims. This morning, youremployer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear, it’strue—it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted toyou—but I came near to giving him my word of honour that that could notbe the right explanation. But now that I see your incomprehensible stubbornnessI no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor isyour position all that secure. I had originally intended to say all this to youin private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason Idon’t see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your turnover hasbeen very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it’s not the time ofyear to do especially good business, we recognise that; but there simply is notime of year to do no business at all, Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there tobe.”“But Sir”, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else inthe excitement, “I’ll open up immediately, just a moment. I’mslightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven’t been able to get up.I’m still in bed now. I’m quite fresh again now, though. I’mjust getting out of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It’s not quite aseasy as I’d thought. I’m quite alright now, though. It’sshocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night,my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of itlast night already. They must have noticed it. I don’t know why Ididn’t let you know at work! But you always think you can get over anillness without staying at home. Please, don’t make my parents suffer!There’s no basis for any of the accusations you’re making;nobody’s ever said a word to me about any of these things. Maybe youhaven’t read the latest contracts I sent in. I’ll set off with theeight o’clock train, as well, these few hours of rest have given mestrength. You don’t need to wait, sir; I’ll be in the office soonafter you, and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend meto him!”And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was saying, hemade his way over to the chest of drawers—this was easily done, probablybecause of the practise he had already had in bed—where he now tried toget himself upright. He really did want to open the door, really did want tolet them see him and to speak with the chief clerk; the others were being soinsistent, and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caughtsight of him. If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor’sresponsibility and he could rest. If, however, they took everything calmly hewould still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be atthe station for eight o’clock. The first few times he tried to climb upon the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gavehimself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body wasin serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let himselffall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of itwith his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that hecould listen to what the chief clerk was saying.“Did you understand a word of all that?” the chief clerk asked hisparents, “surely he’s not trying to make fools of us”.“Oh, God!” called his mother, who was already in tears, “hecould be seriously ill and we’re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!”she then cried. “Mother?” his sister called from the other side.They communicated across Gregor’s room. “You’ll have to gofor the doctor straight away. Gregor is ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did youhear the way Gregor spoke just now?” “That was the voice of ananimal”, said the chief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast withhis mother’s screams. “Anna! Anna!” his father called intothe kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping his hands, “get alocksmith here, now!” And the two girls, their skirts swishing,immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flatas they went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There wasno sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it open; peopleoften do in homes where something awful has happened.Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn’t understandhis words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer thanbefore—perhaps his ears had become used to the sound. They had realised,though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help. Thefirst response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made himfeel better. He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from thedoctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprisingachievements—although he did not really distinguish one from the other.Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to make his voice asclear as possible, he coughed a little, but taking care to do this not tooloudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughsand he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it hadbecome very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the tablewhispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed against thedoor and listening.Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once there he letgo of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against itusing the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He rested there a little while torecover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turningthe key in the lock with his mouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no properteeth—how was he, then, to grasp the key?—but the lack of teethwas, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he reallywas able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have beencausing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed overthe key and dripped onto the floor. “Listen”, said the chief clerkin the next room, “he’s turning the key.” Gregor was greatlyencouraged by this; but they all should have been calling to him, his fatherand his mother too: “Well done, Gregor”, they should have cried,“keep at it, keep hold of the lock!” And with the idea that theywere all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all hisstrength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the keyturned round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself uprightwith his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the wholeweight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it snapped backwas Gregor’s sign that he could break his concentration, and as heregained his breath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need thelocksmith after all”. Then he lay his head on the handle of the door toopen it completely.Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open before hecould be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the doubledoors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat onhis back before entering the room. He was still occupied with this difficultmovement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chiefclerk exclaim a loud “Oh!”, which sounded like the soughing of thewind. Now he also saw him—he was the nearest to the door—his handpressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steadyand invisible force. Gregor’s mother, her hair still dishevelled from beddespite the chief clerk’s being there, looked at his father. Then sheunfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto thefloor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her headdisappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and clenched hisfists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room. Then he lookeduncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept sothat his powerful chest shook.So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the otherdoor which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half of his bodycould be seen, along with his head above it which he leant over to one side ashe peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had become much lighter; part ofthe endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street—whichwas a hospital—could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regularline of windows piercing its façade; the rain was still falling, now throwingdown large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washingup from breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, forGregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and hewould stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of differentnewspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when hewas a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on hisface as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing. The door to theentrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he couldsee onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below.“Now, then”, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one tohave kept calm, “I’ll get dressed straight away now, pack up mysamples and set off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see”, hesaid to the chief clerk, “that I’m not stubborn and I like to do myjob; being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling Icouldn’t earn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes?Will you report everything accurately, then? It’s quite possible forsomeone to be temporarily unable to work, but that’s just the right timeto remember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that later on,once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all the morediligence and concentration. You’re well aware that I’m seriouslyin debt to our employer as well as having to look after my parents and mysister, so that I’m trapped in a difficult situation, but I will work myway out of it again. Please don’t make things any harder for me than theyare already, and don’t take sides against me at the office. I know thatnobody likes the travellers. They think we earn an enormous wage as well ashaving a soft time of it. That’s just prejudice but they have noparticular reason to think better of it. But you, sir, you have a betteroverview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence,a better overview than the boss himself—it’s very easy for abusinessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them moreharshly than he should. And you’re also well aware that we travellersspend almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very easilyfall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it’salmost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don’tusually even hear about them, or if at all it’s when we arrive back homeexhausted from a trip, and that’s when we feel the harmful effects ofwhat’s been going on without even knowing what caused them. Please,don’t go away, at least first say something to show that you grant thatI’m at least partly right!”But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak,and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his trembling shouldersas he left. He did not keep still for a moment while Gregor was speaking, butmoved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him. He moved verygradually, as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room. Itwas only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement,drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall,he stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there, therewere some supernatural force waiting to save him.Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go awayin this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger.That was something his parents did not understand very well; over the years,they had become convinced that this job would provide for Gregor for his entirelife, and besides, they had so much to worry about at present that they hadlost sight of any thought for the future. Gregor, though, did think about thefuture. The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finallywon over; the future of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only hissister were here! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor wasstill lying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women,surely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the entrancehall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was not there,Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without considering that he stillwas not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state, orthat his speech still might not—or probably would not—beunderstood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through the opening; tried toreach the chief clerk on the landing who, ridiculously, was holding on to thebanister with both hands; but Gregor fell immediately over and, with a littlescream as he sought something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs.Hardly had that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feelalright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them; to hispleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even making the effort tocarry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon believing that all his sorrowswould soon be finally at an end. He held back the urge to move but swayed fromside to side as he crouched there on the floor. His mother was not far away infront of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then shesuddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting:“Help, for pity’s sake, Help!” The way she held her headsuggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the unthinking way she washurrying backwards showed that she did not; she had forgotten that the tablewas behind her with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the tableshe sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without evenseeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush ofcoffee was pouring down onto the carpet.“Mother, mother”, said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He hadcompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help himselfsnapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee. That sethis mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and into the arms of hisfather as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though, had no time to spare for hisparents now; the chief clerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin onthe banister, he looked back for the last time. Gregor made a run for him; hewanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have expectedsomething, as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared; his shoutsresounding all around the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed,unfortunately, to put Gregor’s father into a panic as well. Until then hehad been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running after thechief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him,Gregor’s father seized the chief clerk’s stick in his right hand(the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his hat andovercoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with his left, and usedthem to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping his foot at him as he went.Gregor’s appeals to his father were of no help, his appeals were simplynot understood, however much he humbly turned his head his father merelystamped his foot all the harder. Across the room, despite the chilly weather,Gregor’s mother had pulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressedher hands to her face. A strong draught of air flew in from the street towardsthe stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered andsome of them were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor’sfather as he drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man.Gregor had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to govery slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have beenback in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time todo that his father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a lethalblow to his back or head from the stick in his father’s hand any moment.Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw, to hisdisgust, that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line; sohe began, as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at hisfather, to turn himself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father wasable to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact nowand then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as towhich way to turn. If only his father would stop that unbearable hissing! Itwas making Gregor quite confused. When he had nearly finished turning round,still listening to that hissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back alittle the way he had just come. He was pleased when he finally had his head infront of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was toobroad to get through it without further difficulty. In his present mood, itobviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors sothat Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was merely fixed on theidea that Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible. Norwould he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright aspreparation for getting through the doorway. What he did, making more noisethan ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there had beennothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there was now more than onefather behind him; it was not a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himselfinto the doorway without regard for what might happen. One side of his bodylifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on thewhite door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon hewas stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself, thelittle legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the otherside were pressed painfully against the ground. Then his father gave him ahefty shove from behind which released him from where he was held and sent himflying, and heavily bleeding, deep into his room. The door was slammed shutwith the stick, then, finally, all was quiet.IIIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from hisdeep and coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if hehadn’t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested.But he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the doorleading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him. The light fromthe electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and topsof the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushedhimself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae—ofwhich he was now beginning to learn the value—in order to see what hadbeen happening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfullystretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the legshad been badly injured in the events of that morning—it was nearly amiracle that only one of them had been—and dragged along lifelessly.It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually wasthat had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of something to eat. By thedoor there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of whitebread floating in it. He was so pleased he almost laughed, as he was evenhungrier than he had been that morning, and immediately dipped his head intothe milk, nearly covering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head backagain in disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make itdifficult to eat the food—he was only able to eat if his whole bodyworked together as a snuffling whole—but the milk did not taste at allnice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister hadcertainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned, almost againsthis own will, away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been lit inthe living room. His father at this time would normally be sat with his eveningpaper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor’s mother, and sometimesto his sister, but there was now not a sound to be heard. Gregor’s sisterwould often write and tell him about this reading, but maybe his father hadlost the habit in recent times. It was so quiet all around too, even thoughthere must have been somebody in the flat. “What a quiet life it is thefamily lead”, said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness, felta great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in such a nice homefor his sister and parents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth andcomfort should come to a horrible and frightening end? That was something thatGregor did not want to think about too much, so he started to move about,crawling up and down the room.Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was opened veryslightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on the other side didthe same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better ofit. Gregor went and waited immediately by the door, resolved either to bringthe timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who itwas; but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in vain. Theprevious morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get inthere to him, but now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the otherhad clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keyswere in the other sides.It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was putout, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awakeall that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away togetheron tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come into Gregor’s room anymore until morning; that gave him plenty of time to think undisturbed about howhe would have to re-arrange his life. For some reason, the tall, empty roomwhere he was forced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on thefloor, even though he had been living in it for five years. Hardly aware ofwhat he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under thecouch. It pressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lifthis head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only regret wasthat his body was too broad to get it all underneath.He spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light sleep,although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger, and some ofthe time was spent in worries and vague hopes which, however, always led to thesame conclusion: for the time being he must remain calm, he must show patienceand the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantnessthat he, in his present condition, was forced to impose on them.Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions, as earlythe next morning, almost before the night had ended, his sister, nearly fullydressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in. She didnot see him straight away, but when she did notice him under the couch—hehad to be somewhere, for God’s sake, he couldn’t have flownaway—she was so shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed thedoor shut again from outside. But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as sheopened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if entering theroom of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his headforward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice thathe had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hungerand bring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn’t doit herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it, although hedid feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch, throw himself athis sister’s feet and beg her for something good to eat. However, hissister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops ofmilk splashed around it with some surprise. She immediately picked itup—using a rag, not her bare hands—and carried it out. Gregor wasextremely curious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining thewildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his sister, in hergoodness, actually did bring. In order to test his taste, she brought him awhole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old,half-rotten vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white saucethat had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor haddeclared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with butterand salt. As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish, whichhad probably been permanently set aside for Gregor’s use, and placed itbeside them. Then, out of consideration for Gregor’s feelings, as sheknew that he would not eat in front of her, she hurried out again and eventurned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he could make things ascomfortable for himself as he liked. Gregor’s little legs whirred, atlast he could eat. What’s more, his injuries must already have completelyhealed as he found no difficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than amonth earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of howhis finger had still hurt the day before yesterday. “Am I less sensitivethan I used to be, then?”, he thought, and was already sucking greedilyat the cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him muchmore than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another, his eyeswatering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce;the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn’t like at all, and evendragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because hecouldn’t stand the smell. Long after he had finished eating and laylethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turned the key in the lock as asign to him that he should withdraw. He was immediately startled, although hehad been half asleep, and he hurried back under the couch. But he needed greatself-control to stay there even for the short time that his sister was in theroom, as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he couldhardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with bulgingeyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs,mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could notbe used any more. She quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with itswooden lid, and carried everything out. She had hardly turned her back beforeGregor came out again from under the couch and stretched himself.This was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning whilehis parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time after everyonehad eaten their meal at midday as his parents would sleep for a little whilethen as well, and Gregor’s sister would send the maid away on someerrand. Gregor’s father and mother certainly did not want him to starveeither, but perhaps it would have been more than they could stand to have anymore experience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his sisterwanted to spare them what distress she could as they were indeed sufferingenough.It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor and thelocksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As nobody couldunderstand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that he could understandthem, so he had to be content to hear his sister’s sighs and appeals tothe saints as she moved about his room. It was only later, when she had becomea little more used to everything—there was, of course, no question of herever becoming fully used to the situation—that Gregor would sometimescatch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could be construed asfriendly. “He’s enjoyed his dinner today”, she might say whenhe had diligently cleared away all the food left for him, or if he left most ofit, which slowly became more and more frequent, she would often say, sadly,“now everything’s just been left there again”.Although Gregor wasn’t able to hear any news directly he did listen tomuch of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard anyone speakinghe would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his whole bodyagainst it. There was seldom any conversation, especially at first, that wasnot about him in some way, even if only in secret. For two whole days, all thetalk at every mealtime was about what they should do now; but even betweenmeals they spoke about the same subject as there were always at least twomembers of the family at home—nobody wanted to be at home by themselvesand it was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty. And on thevery first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged Gregor’smother to let her go without delay. It was not very clear how much she knew ofwhat had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thankingGregor’s mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormousservice. She even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest aboutwhat had happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.Now Gregor’s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. Gregor oftenheard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive nomore answer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough” or somethingsimilar. No-one drank very much either. His sister would sometimes ask hisfather whether he would like a beer, hoping for the chance to go and fetch itherself. When his father then said nothing she would add, so that he would notfeel selfish, that she could send the housekeeper for it, but then his fatherwould close the matter with a big, loud “No”, and no more would besaid.Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained toGregor’s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were. Nowand then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from thelittle cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five yearsearlier. Gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed itagain after he had taken the item he wanted. What he heard his father say wassome of the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first beenincarcerated in his room. He had thought that nothing at all remained from hisfather’s business, at least he had never told him anything different, andGregor had never asked him about it anyway. Their business misfortune hadreduced the family to a state of total despair, and Gregor’s only concernat that time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about itas quickly as possible. So then he started working especially hard, with afiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travellingrepresentative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earn money inquite different ways. Gregor converted his success at work straight into cashthat he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished anddelighted family. They had been good times and they had never come again, atleast not with the same splendour, even though Gregor had later earned so muchthat he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bearthem. They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took themoney with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was nolonger much warm affection given in return. Gregor only remained close to hissister now. Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressiveviolinist, it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory next yeareven though it would cause great expense that would have to be made up for insome other way. During Gregor’s short periods in town, conversation withhis sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentionedas a lovely dream that could never be realised. Their parents did not like tohear this innocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided hewould let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it onChristmas day.That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in hispresent state, pressed upright against the door and listening. There were timeswhen he simply became too tired to continue listening, when his head would fallwearily against the door and he would pull it up again with a start, as eventhe slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all gosilent. “What’s that he’s doing now”, his father wouldsay after a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then wouldthe interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.When explaining things, his father repeated himself several times, partlybecause it was a long time since he had been occupied with these mattershimself and partly because Gregor’s mother did not understand everythingthe first time. From these repeated explanations Gregor learned, to hispleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was still some moneyavailable from the old days. It was not a lot, but it had not been touched inthe meantime and some interest had accumulated. Besides that, they had not beenusing up all the money that Gregor had been bringing home every month, keepingonly a little for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating. Behind thedoor, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thriftand caution. He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce hisfather’s debt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himselffrom that job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better theway his father had done things.This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live offthe interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one or two years, nomore. That’s to say, it was money that should not really be touched butset aside for emergencies; money to live on had to be earned. His father washealthy but old, and lacking in self confidence. During the five years that hehad not been working—the first holiday in a life that had been full ofstrain and no success—he had put on a lot of weight and become very slowand clumsy. Would Gregor’s elderly mother now have to go and earn money?She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about thehome, every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by theopen window. Would his sister have to go and earn money? She was still a childof seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consisting ofwearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business, joining inwith a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin. Whenever theybegan to talk of the need to earn money, Gregor would always first let go ofthe door and then throw himself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as hebecame quite hot with shame and regret.He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink butscratching at the leather for hours on end. Or he might go to all the effort ofpushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill and, propped up in thechair, leaning on the window to stare out of it. He had used to feel a greatsense of freedom from doing this, but doing it now was obviously something moreremembered than experienced, as what he actually saw in this way was becomingless distinct every day, even things that were quite near; he had used to cursethe ever-present view of the hospital across the street, but now he could notsee it at all, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse,which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could havethought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey skyand the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant sister only needed tonotice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exactposition by the window after she had tidied up the room, and even left theinner pane of the window open from then on.If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all thatshe had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it; but as itwas it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried as far as possible topretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the longer it went on, ofcourse, the better she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was alsoable to see through it all so much better. It had even become very unpleasantfor him, now, whenever she entered the room. No sooner had she come in than shewould quickly close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have tosuffer the view into Gregor’s room, then she would go straight to thewindow and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if itwas cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while. Shewould alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and noise making; hewould stay under the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well thatshe would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal, but it was impossiblefor her to be in the same room with him with the windows closed.One day, about a month after Gregor’s transformation when his sister nolonger had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she came intothe room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out thewindow, motionless, and just where he would be most horrible. In itself, hissister’s not coming into the room would have been no surprise for Gregoras it would have been difficult for her to immediately open the window while hewas still there, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back andclosed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he had threatened herand tried to bite her. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, ofcourse, but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and sheseemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still foundhis appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she probably even had toovercome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that protrudedfrom under the couch. One day, in order to spare her even this sight, he spentfour hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged itso that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see himeven if she bent down. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then allshe had to do was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was nopleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely. She left the sheet whereit was. Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when hecarefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked the newarrangement.For the first fourteen days, Gregor’s parents could not bring themselvesto come into the room to see him. He would often hear them say how theyappreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though, before, they hadseen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed withher. But now the two of them, father and mother, would often both wait outsidethe door of Gregor’s room while his sister tidied up in there, and assoon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everythinglooked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether,perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go inand visit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuadedher against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and approved fully.Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which made her call out:“Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son! Can’t youunderstand I have to see him?”, and Gregor would think to himself thatmaybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every day of course, butone day a week, perhaps; she could understand everything much better than hissister who, for all her courage, was still just a child after all, and reallymight not have had an adult’s appreciation of the burdensome job she hadtaken on.Gregor’s wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of considerationfor his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during theday, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawlabout, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his food soon stoppedgiving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into thehabit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling. He was especially fond ofhanging from the ceiling; it was quite different from lying on the floor; hecould breathe more freely; his body had a light swing to it; and up there,relaxed and almost happy, it might happen that he would surprise even himselfby letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash. But now, ofcourse, he had far better control of his body than before and, even with a fallas great as that, caused himself no damage. Very soon his sister noticedGregor’s new way of entertaining himself—he had, after all, lefttraces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about—and got it intoher head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing the furniture thatgot in his way, especially the chest of drawers and the desk. Now, this was notsomething that she would be able to do by herself; she did not dare to ask forhelp from her father; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely sincethe cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, she had evenasked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to haveto open the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had nochoice but to choose some time when Gregor’s father was not there andfetch his mother to help her. As she approached the room, Gregor could hear hismother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent. First, of course,his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room wasalright; and only then did she let her mother enter. Gregor had hurriedlypulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so thateverything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance. Gregoralso refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up thechance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come.“You can come in, he can’t be seen”, said his sister,obviously leading her in by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavyfor a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as theypushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of thework for herself and ignoring her mother’s warnings that she would strainherself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at it for fifteenminutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the chest where itwas, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the job finished beforeGregor’s father got home and leaving it in the middle of the room itwould be in his way even more, and for another thing it wasn’t even surethat taking the furniture away would really be any help to him. She thoughtjust the opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart;and why wouldn’t Gregor feel the same way about it, he’d been usedto this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make him feelabandoned to be in an empty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering asif wanting Gregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even thetone of her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her words,she added “and by taking the furniture away, won’t it seem likewe’re showing that we’ve given up all hope of improvement andwe’re abandoning him to cope for himself? I think it’d be best toleave the room exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back tous again he’ll find everything unchanged and he’ll be able toforget the time in between all the easier”.Hearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack of anydirect human communication, along with the monotonous life led by the familyduring these two months, must have made him confused—he could think of noother way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptiedout. Had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fittedout with the nice furniture he had inherited? That would have let him crawlaround unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let him quicklyforget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close toforgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for so long,that had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed; everything had tostay; he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on hiscondition; and if the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl aboutmindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage.His sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the idea, notwithout reason, that she was Gregor’s spokesman to his parents about thethings that concerned him. This meant that his mother’s advice now wassufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawersand the desk, as she had thought at first, but all the furniture apart from theall-important couch. It was more than childish perversity, of course, or theunexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made her insist; she hadindeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas thefurniture, as far as anyone could see, was of no use to him at all. Girls ofthat age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel they must gettheir way whenever they can. Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to makeGregor’s situation seem even more shocking than it was so that she coulddo even more for him. Grete would probably be the only one who would dare entera room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare walls by himself.So she refused to let her mother dissuade her. Gregor’s mother alreadylooked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped Gregor’ssister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she had. The chest ofdrawers was something that Gregor could do without if he had to, but thewriting desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers,groaning, out of the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couchto see what he could do about it. He meant to be as careful and considerate ashe could, but, unfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Gretein the next room had her arms round the chest, pushing and pulling at it fromside to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch. His mother wasnot used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so Gregor hurriedbackwards to the far end of the couch. In his startlement, though, he was notable to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a little. It was enough toattract his mother’s attention. She stood very still, remained there amoment, and then went back out to Grete.Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening, it wasjust a few pieces of furniture being moved after all, but he soon had to admitthat the women going to and fro, their little calls to each other, the scrapingof the furniture on the floor, all these things made him feel as if he werebeing assailed from all sides. With his head and legs pulled in against him andhis body pressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he couldnot stand all of this much longer. They were emptying his room out; taking awayeverything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chestcontaining his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove thewriting desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk where he haddone his homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while he had beenat infant school—he really could not wait any longer to see whether thetwo women’s intentions were good. He had nearly forgotten they were thereanyway, as they were now too tired to say anything while they worked and hecould only hear their feet as they stepped heavily on the floor.So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catchingtheir breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not knowing what heshould save first before his attention was suddenly caught by the picture onthe wall—which was already denuded of everything else that had been onit—of the lady dressed in copious fur. He hurried up onto the picture andpressed himself against its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hotbelly. This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly betaken away by no-one. He turned his head to face the door into the living roomso that he could watch the women when they came back.They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon; Grete hadput her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her. “What shall wetake now, then?”, said Grete and looked around. Her eyes met those ofGregor on the wall. Perhaps only because her mother was there, she remainedcalm, bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said, albeithurriedly and with a tremor in her voice: “Come on, let’s go backin the living room for a while?” Gregor could see what Grete had in mind,she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down from thewall. Well, she could certainly try it! He sat unyielding on his picture. Hewould rather jump at Grete’s face.But Grete’s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to oneside, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper, andbefore she even realised it was Gregor that she saw screamed: “Oh God, ohGod!” Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch as if she had given upeverything and stayed there immobile. “Gregor!” shouted his sister,glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the first word she had spokento him directly since his transformation. She ran into the other room to fetchsome kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wantedto help too—he could save his picture later, although he stuck fast tothe glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he, too, ran into the nextroom as if he could advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to juststand behind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, hestartled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; asplinter cut Gregor’s face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed allover him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottlesshe could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the door shut withher foot. So now Gregor was shut out from his mother, who, because of him,might be near to death; he could not open the door if he did not want to chasehis sister away, and she had to stay with his mother; there was nothing for himto do but wait; and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began tocrawl about, he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finallyin his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down intothe middle of the dinner table.He lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was quiet, maybethat was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door. The maid, of course,had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and answer it.His father had arrived home. “What’s happened?” were hisfirst words; Grete’s appearance must have made everything clear to him.She answered him with subdued voice, and openly pressed her face into hischest: “Mother’s fainted, but she’s better now. Gregor gotout.” “Just as I expected”, said his father, “just as Ialways said, but you women wouldn’t listen, would you.” It wasclear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father took it tomean that something bad had happened, that he was responsible for some act ofviolence. That meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as he didnot have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible. Sohe fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that hisfather, when he came in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor hadthe best intentions and would go back into his room without delay, that itwould not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open thedoor and he would disappear.His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that;“Ah!”, he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angryand glad at the same time. Gregor drew his head back from the door and liftedit towards his father. He really had not imagined his father the way he stoodthere now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about, he had neglected topay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way he had donebefore. He really ought to have expected things to have changed, but still,still, was that really his father? The same tired man as used to be layingthere entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his business trips, whowould receive him sitting in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back inthe evenings; who was hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of hispleasure, would just raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year whenthey went for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightlyin his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always labour his wayforward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking slowly for hissake; who would place his stick down carefully and, if he wanted to saysomething would invariably stop and gather his companions around him. He wasstanding up straight enough now; dressed in a smart blue uniform with goldbuttons, the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute; above thehigh, stiff collar of the coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushyeyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normallyunkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp. He took hiscap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in an arcright across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his trouser pockets,pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and, with look ofdetermination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not even know himselfwhat he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high. Gregor wasamazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time withthat—he knew full well, right from the first day of his new life, thathis father thought it necessary to always be extremely strict with him. And sohe ran up to his father, stopped when his father stopped, scurried forwardsagain when he moved, even slightly. In this way they went round the roomseveral times without anything decisive happening, without even giving theimpression of a chase as everything went so slowly. Gregor remained all thistime on the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it asespecially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever he did,Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this runningabout for long, as for each step his father took he had to carry out countlessmovements. He became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life hislungs had not been very reliable. Now, as he lurched about in his efforts tomuster all the strength he could for running he could hardly keep his eyesopen; his thoughts became too slow for him to think of any other way of savinghimself than running; he almost forgot that the walls were there for him to usealthough, here, they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full ofnotches and protrusions—then, right beside him, lightly tossed, somethingflew down and rolled in front of him. It was an apple; then another oneimmediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was no longer any pointin running as his father had decided to bombard him. He had filled his pocketswith fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the timefor careful aim, threw one apple after another. These little, red apples rolledabout on the floor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. Anapple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor’s back and slidoff without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following it, hitsquarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself away, as if hecould remove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing his position; buthe felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out, all his senses inconfusion. The last thing he saw was the door of his room being pulled open,his sister was screaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (ashis sister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to make iteasier for her to breathe), she ran to his father, her skirts unfastened andsliding one after another to the ground, stumbling over the skirts she pushedherself to his father, her arms around him, uniting herself with himtotally—now Gregor lost his ability to see anything—her handsbehind his father’s head begging him to spare Gregor’s life.IIINo-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor’s flesh, so it remainedthere as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it there for morethan a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to remind even his fatherthat Gregor, despite his current sad and revolting form, was a family memberwho could not be treated as an enemy. On the contrary, as a family there was aduty to swallow any revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.Because of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility—probablypermanently. He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and ittook him long, long minutes to crawl across his room—crawling over theceiling was out of the question—but this deterioration in his conditionwas fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the living room beingleft open every evening. He got into the habit of closely watching it for oneor two hours before it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his roomwhere he could not be seen from the living room, he could watch the family inthe light of the dinner table and listen to their conversation—witheveryone’s permission, in a way, and thus quite differently from before.They no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of course, theones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he was tired andgetting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. All of them were usuallyvery quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, his father would go to sleep in hischair; his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet; his mother,bent deeply under the lamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; hissister, who had taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the eveningsso that she might be able to get a better position later on. Sometimes hisfather would wake up and say to Gregor’s mother “you’re doingso much sewing again today!”, as if he did not know that he had beendozing—and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sisterwould exchange a tired grin.With a kind of stubbornness, Gregor’s father refused to take his uniformoff even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg Gregor’sfather would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always ready to serveand expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here. The uniform had notbeen new to start with, but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbierdespite the efforts of Gregor’s mother and sister to look after it.Gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on thiscoat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old manin it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful.As soon as it struck ten, Gregor’s mother would speak gently to hisfather to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn’tsleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to beup at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he had become moreobstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even thoughhe regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him toexchange the chair for his bed. Then, however much mother and sister wouldimportune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shakinghis head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up.Gregor’s mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into hisear, Gregor’s sister would leave her work to help her mother, but nothingwould have any effect on him. He would just sink deeper into his chair. Onlywhen the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes,look at them one after the other and say: “What a life! This is whatpeace I get in my old age!” And supported by the two women he would lifthimself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself, let thewomen take him to the door, send them off and carry on by himself whileGregor’s mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen sothat they could run after his father and continue being of help to him.Who, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give moreattention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The household budget becameeven smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous, thick-boned charwomanwith white hair that flapped around her head came every morning and evening todo the heaviest work; everything else was looked after by Gregor’s motheron top of the large amount of sewing work she did. Gregor even learned,listening to the evening conversation about what price they had hoped for, thatseveral items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even thoughboth mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions andcelebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much toobig for their present circumstances, they could not move out of it, there wasno imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address. He could see quitewell, though, that there were more reasons than consideration for him that madeit difficult for them to move, it would have been quite easy to transport himin any suitable crate with a few air holes in it; the main thing holding thefamily back from their decision to move was much more to do with their totaldespair, and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlikeanything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. They carriedout absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people,Gregor’s father brought bank employees their breakfast, his mothersacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister ran back andforth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but they just did nothave the strength to do any more. And the injury in Gregor’s back beganto hurt as much as when it was new. After they had come back from taking hisfather to bed Gregor’s mother and sister would now leave their work whereit was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother would point toGregor’s room and say “Close that door, Grete”, and then,when he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room and their tearswould mingle, or they would simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table.Gregor hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes he would think oftaking over the family’s affairs, just like before, the next time thedoor was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk, butthey would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen and the apprentices, thatstupid teaboy, two or three friends from other businesses, one of thechambermaids from a provincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared anddisappeared again, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had beenserious but too slow,—all of them appeared to him, mixed together withstrangers and others he had forgotten, but instead of helping him and hisfamily they were all of them inaccessible, and he was glad when theydisappeared. Other times he was not at all in the mood to look after hisfamily, he was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention he wasshown, and although he could think of nothing he would have wanted, he madeplans of how he could get into the pantry where he could take all the things hewas entitled to, even if he was not hungry. Gregor’s sister no longerthought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food orother into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the morningand at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it away again with the broom,indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or—more often thannot—had been left totally untouched. She still cleared up the room in theevening, but now she could not have been any quicker about it. Smears of dirtwere left on the walls, here and there were little balls of dust and filth. Atfirst, Gregor went into one of the worst of these places when his sisterarrived as a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks withouthis sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he couldbut she had simply decided to leave him to it. At the same time she becametouchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the familyunderstood—cleaning up Gregor’s room was for her and her alone.Gregor’s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to useseveral bucketfuls of water to do it—although that much dampness alsomade Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But hismother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly had hissister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change inGregor’s room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living room where,despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she broke into convulsivetears. Her father, of course, was startled out of his chair and the two parentslooked on astonished and helpless; then they, too, became agitated;Gregor’s father, standing to the right of his mother, accused her of notleaving the cleaning of Gregor’s room to his sister; from her left,Gregor’s sister screamed at her that she was never to cleanGregor’s room again; while his mother tried to draw his father, who wasbeside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with tears,thumped on the table with her small fists; and Gregor hissed in anger thatno-one had even thought of closing the door to save him the sight of this andall its noise.Gregor’s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking afterGregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but even so hismother ought certainly not to have taken her place. Gregor, on the other hand,ought not to be neglected. Now, though, the charwoman was here. This elderlywidow, with a robust bone structure that made her able to withstand the hardestof things in her long life, wasn’t really repelled by Gregor. Just bychance one day, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door toGregor’s room and found herself face to face with him. He was takentotally by surprise, no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and frowhile she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in front of her.From then on she never failed to open the door slightly every evening andmorning and look briefly in on him. At first she would call to him as she didso with words that she probably considered friendly, such as “come onthen, you old dung-beetle!”, or “look at the old dung-beetlethere!” Gregor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but justremained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been opened.If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day instead ofletting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt like it! One day, earlyin the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes, perhaps indicatingthat spring was coming, she began to speak to him in that way once again.Gregor was so resentful of it that he started to move toward her, he was slowand infirm, but it was like a kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, thecharwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood therewith her mouth open, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chairin her hand had been slammed down into Gregor’s back. “Aren’tyou coming any closer, then?”, she asked when Gregor turned round again,and she calmly put the chair back in the corner.Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating. Only if he happened to find himselfnext to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it intohis mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours and then, more often thannot, spit it out again. At first he thought it was distress at the state of hisroom that stopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes madethere. They had got into the habit of putting things into this room that theyhad no room for anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one ofthe rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnestgentlemen—all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peeringthrough the crack in the door one day—were painfully insistent onthings’ being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since theyhad taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially inthe kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate,especially if it was dirty. They had moreover brought most of their ownfurnishings and equipment with them. For this reason, many things had becomesuperfluous which, although they could not be sold, the family did not wish todiscard. All these things found their way into Gregor’s room. Thedustbins from the kitchen found their way in there too. The charwoman wasalways in a hurry, and anything she couldn’t use for the time being shewould just chuck in there. He, fortunately, would usually see no more than theobject and the hand that held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch thethings back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to throweverything out in one go, but what actually happened was that they were leftwhere they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his waythrough the junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved it because,with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was forced to, but lateron he came to enjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tiredto death, and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards.The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening meal athome in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the door to this roomwas often kept closed in the evening. But Gregor found it easy to give uphaving the door open, he had, after all, often failed to make use of it when itwas open and, without the family having noticed it, lain in his room in itsdarkest corner. One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the livingroom slightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the roomcame in in the evening and the light was put on. They sat up at the tablewhere, formerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother, theyunfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks. Gregor’smother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behindher came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes. The food wassteaming, and filled the room with its smell. The gentlemen bent over thedishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before eatingit, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as an authority forthe other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in itsdish, clearly wishing to establish whether it was sufficiently cooked orwhether it should be sent back to the kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, andGregor’s mother and sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began tobreathe again and smiled.The family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor’s fathercame into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once with hiscap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen stood as one, andmumbled something into their beards. Then, once they were alone, they ate innear perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the variousnoises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they hadwanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was notpossible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice theymight be. “I’d like to eat something”, said Gregor anxiously,“but not anything like they’re eating. They do feed themselves. Andhere I am, dying!”Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the violinbeing played, but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen. The threegentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the middle had produced anewspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now they leant back in theirchairs reading them and smoking. When the violin began playing they becameattentive, stood up and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway wherethey stood pressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in thekitchen, as Gregor’s father called out: “Is the playing perhapsunpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.” “Onthe contrary”, said the middle gentleman, “would the young lady notlike to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, muchmore cosy and comfortable?” “Oh yes, we’d love to”,called back Gregor’s father as if he had been the violin player himself.The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Gregor’s father soonappeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister withthe violin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin playing; hisparents, who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed anexaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit ontheir own chairs; his father leant against the door with his right hand pushedin between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered aseat by one of the gentlemen and sat—leaving the chair where thegentleman happened to have placed it—out of the way in a corner.His sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one on eachside, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing, Gregor had daredto come forward a little and already had his head in the living room. Before,he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurredto him that he had become so thoughtless about the others. What’s more,there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered inthe dust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest movement;he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; hewas much too indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himselfon the carpet like he had used to do several times a day. And despite thiscondition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculatefloor of the living room.No-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the violinplaying; at first, the three gentlemen had put their hands in their pockets andcome up far too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes beingplayed, and they must have disturbed Gregor’s sister, but soon, incontrast with the family, they withdrew back to the window with their headssunk and talking to each other at half volume, and they stayed by the windowwhile Gregor’s father observed them anxiously. It really now seemed veryobvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violinplaying but had been disappointed, that they had had enough of the wholeperformance and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peaceto be disturbed. It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the smokefrom their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses. Yet Gregor’ssister was playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one side, followingthe lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression. Gregor crawled alittle further forward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he couldmeet her eyes if the chance came. Was he an animal if music could captivate himso? It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishmenthe had been yearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to hissister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with herviolin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He neverwanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway; his shockingappearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at everydoor of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; his sister shouldnot be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of her own free will; shewould sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he toldher how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory, how he wouldhave told everyone about it last Christmas—had Christmas really come andgone already?—if this misfortune hadn’t got in the way, and refuseto let anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would breakout in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss herneck, which, since she had been going out to work, she had kept free withoutany necklace or collar.“Mr. Samsa!”, shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor’sfather, pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregoras he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the threegentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and then lookedback at Gregor. His father seemed to think it more important to calm the threegentlemen before driving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset andseemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been.He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them backinto their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor withhis body. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether itwas his father’s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisationthat they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without knowing it.They asked Gregor’s father for explanations, raised their arms like hehad, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room onlyvery slowly. Meanwhile Gregor’s sister had overcome the despair she hadfallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted. She had let her handsdrop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look atthe music as if still playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together,lay the instrument on her mother’s lap who still sat laboriouslystruggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next room which, underpressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.Under his sister’s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the bedsflew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the bedsand slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room.Gregor’s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgotall the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and pressed them until,when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemenshouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Gregor’sfather to a halt. “I declare here and now”, he said, raising hishand and glancing at Gregor’s mother and sister to gain their attentiontoo, “that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in thisflat and with this family”—here he looked briefly but decisively atthe floor—“I give immediate notice on my room. For the days that Ihave been living here I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary Iwill consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you,and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such anaction.” He was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting forsomething. And indeed, his two friends joined in with the words: “And wealso give immediate notice.” With that, he took hold of the door handleand slammed the door.Gregor’s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with hishands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out for hisusual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it couldbe seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout all this, Gregor had lainstill where the three gentlemen had first seen him. His disappointment at thefailure of his plan, and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made itimpossible for him to move. He was sure that everyone would turn on him anymoment, and he waited. He was not even startled out of this state when theviolin on his mother’s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landedloudly on the floor.“Father, Mother”, said his sister, hitting the table with her handas introduction, “we can’t carry on like this. Maybe youcan’t see it, but I can. I don’t want to call this monster mybrother, all I can say is: we have to try and get rid of it. We’ve doneall that’s humanly possible to look after it and be patient, Idon’t think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong.”“She’s absolutely right”, said Gregor’s father tohimself. His mother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began tocough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in hereyes.Gregor’s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead.Her words seemed to give Gregor’s father some more definite ideas. He satupright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the threegentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at Gregor as he laythere immobile.“We have to try and get rid of it”, said Gregor’s sister, nowspeaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing tolisten, “it’ll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. Wecan’t all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be torturedlike this, we can’t endure it. I can’t endure it any more.”And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of hermother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements.“My child”, said her father with sympathy and obviousunderstanding, “what are we to do?”His sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and tearsthat had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainty.“If he could just understand us”, said his father almost as aquestion; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign thatof that there was no question.“If he could just understand us”, repeated Gregor’s father,closing his eyes in acceptance of his sister’s certainty that that wasquite impossible, “then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangementwith him. But as it is ...”“It’s got to go”, shouted his sister, “that’s theonly way, Father. You’ve got to get rid of the idea that that’sGregor. We’ve only harmed ourselves by believing it for so long. How canthat be Gregor? If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it’snot possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he wouldhave gone of his own free will. We wouldn’t have a brother any more,then, but we could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect. As itis this animal is persecuting us, it’s driven out our tenants, itobviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on thestreets. Father, look, just look”, she suddenly screamed,“he’s starting again!” In her alarm, which was totally beyondGregor’s comprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as shepushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice herown mother than stay anywhere near Gregor. She rushed over to behind herfather, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up half raisinghis hands in front of Gregor’s sister as if to protect her.But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his sister.All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room,although that was in itself quite startling as his pain-wracked condition meantthat turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head tohelp himself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor. Hestopped and looked round. They seemed to have realised his good intention andhad only been alarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence.His mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed againsteach other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to hisfather with her arms around his neck.“Maybe now they’ll let me turn round”, thought Gregor andwent back to work. He could not help panting loudly with the effort and hadsometimes to stop and take a rest. No-one was making him rush any more,everything was left up to him. As soon as he had finally finished turning roundhe began to move straight ahead. He was amazed at the great distance thatseparated him from his room, and could not understand how he had covered thatdistance in his weak state a little while before and almost without noticingit. He concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed thatthere was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did notturn his head until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the wayround as he felt his neck becoming stiff, but it was nonetheless enough to seethat nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood up. With hislast glance he saw that his mother had now fallen completely asleep.He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut, bolted andlocked. The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that his little legscollapsed under him. It was his sister who had been in so much of a rush. Shehad been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly, Gregor had notheard her coming at all, and as she turned the key in the lock she said loudlyto her parents “At last!”.“What now, then?”, Gregor asked himself as he looked round in thedarkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all. Thiswas no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to actually movearound on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural. He also feltrelatively comfortable. It is true that his entire body was aching, but thepain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappearaltogether. He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or theinflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust. He thoughtback of his family with emotion and love. If it was possible, he felt that hemust go away even more strongly than his sister. He remained in this state ofempty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three inthe morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside thewindow too. Then, without his willing it, his head sank down completely, andhis last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.When the cleaner came in early in the morning—they’d often askedher not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry shestill did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she’d arrived and fromthen on it was impossible to sleep in peace—she made her usual brief lookin on Gregor and at first found nothing special. She thought he was layingthere so still on purpose, playing the martyr; she attributed all possibleunderstanding to him. She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, soshe tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway. When she had no successwith that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little,and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistanceat all did she start to pay attention. She soon realised what had reallyhappened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but did not waste time toyank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms:“Come and ’ave a look at this, it’s dead, just lying there,stone dead!”Mr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to make aneffort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they could grasp whatshe was saying. But then, each from his own side, they hurried out of bed. Mr.Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders, Mrs. Samsa just came out in hernightdress; and that is how they went into Gregor’s room. On the way theyopened the door to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since thethree gentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never beenasleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this.“Dead?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly,even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it evenwithout checking. “That’s what I said”, replied the cleaner,and to prove it she gave Gregor’s body another shove with the broom,sending it sideways across the floor. Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if shewanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete it. “Now then”,said Mr. Samsa, “let’s give thanks to God for that”. Hecrossed himself, and the three women followed his example. Grete, who had nottaken her eyes from the corpse, said: “Just look how thin he was. Hedidn’t eat anything for so long. The food came out again just the same aswhen it went in”. Gregor’s body was indeed completely dried up andflat, they had not seen it until then, but now he was not lifted up on hislittle legs, nor did he do anything to make them look away.“Grete, come with us in here for a little while”, said Mrs. Samsawith a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but notwithout looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened thewindow wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air hadsomething of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of March, afterall.The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement fortheir breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. “Where is ourbreakfast?”, the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably. She justput her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men thatthey might like to come into Gregor’s room. They did so, and stood aroundGregor’s corpse with their hands in the pockets of their well-worn coats.It was now quite light in the room.Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his uniform withhis wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of them had been cryinga little; Grete now and then pressed her face against her father’s arm.“Leave my home. Now!”, said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door andwithout letting the women from him. “What do you mean?”, asked themiddle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. Theother two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed themtogether in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end intheir favour. “I mean just what I said”, answered Mr. Samsa, and,with his two companions, went in a straight line towards the man. At first, hestood there still, looking at the ground as if the contents of his head wererearranging themselves into new positions. “Alright, we’ll gothen”, he said, and looked up at Mr. Samsa as if he had been suddenlyovercome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr. Samsa for hisdecision. Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to himseveral times. At that, and without delay, the man actually did take longstrides into the front hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their handssome time before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they jumpedoff after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr. Samsa might gointo the hallway in front of them and break the connection with their leader.Once there, all three took their hats from the stand, took their sticks fromthe holder, bowed without a word and left the premises. Mr. Samsa and the twowomen followed them out onto the landing; but they had had no reason tomistrust the men’s intentions and as they leaned over the landing theysaw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps.As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear afew moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa familylost interest in them; when a butcher’s boy, proud of posture with histray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer than they were, Mr.Samsa and the women came away from the landing and went, as if relieved, backinto the flat.They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to gofor a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but they were in seriousneed of it. So they sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal, Mr.Samsa to his employers, Mrs. Samsa to her contractor and Grete to herprincipal. The cleaner came in while they were writing to tell them she wasgoing, she’d finished her work for that morning. The three of them atfirst just nodded without looking up from what they were writing, and it wasonly when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked upin irritation. “Well?”, asked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in thedoorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news toreport, but would only do it if she was clearly asked to. The almost verticallittle ostrich feather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr.Samsa all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in alldirections. “What is it you want then?”, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom thecleaner had the most respect for. “Yes”, she answered, and brokeinto a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, “wellthen, that thing in there, you needn’t worry about how you’re goingto get rid of it. That’s all been sorted out.” Mrs. Samsa and Gretebent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they werewriting; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everythingin detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite clear that she was notto. So, as she was prevented from telling them all about it, she suddenlyremembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, called out“Cheerio then, everyone”, turned round sharply and left, slammingthe door terribly as she went.“Tonight she gets sacked”, said Mr. Samsa, but he received no replyfrom either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyedthe peace they had only just gained. They got up and went over to the windowwhere they remained with their arms around each other. Mr. Samsa twisted roundin his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while. Then he calledout: “Come here, then. Let’s forget about all that old stuff, shallwe. Come and give me a bit of attention”. The two women immediately didas he said, hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and thenthey quickly finished their letters.After that, the three of them left the flat together, which was something theyhad not done for months, and took the tram out to the open country outside thetown. They had the tram, filled with warm sunshine, all to themselves. Leantback comfortably on their seats, they discussed their prospects and found thaton closer examination they were not at all bad—until then they had neverasked each other about their work but all three had jobs which were very goodand held particularly good promise for the future. The greatest improvement forthe time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving house; whatthey needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current onewhich had been chosen by Gregor, one that was in a better location and, most ofall, more practical. All the time, Grete was becoming livelier. With all theworry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but, while theywere talking, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with thethought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautifulyoung lady. They became quieter. Just from each other’s glance and almostwithout knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good manfor her. And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions, assoon as they reached their destination Grete was the first to get up andstretch out her young body.*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK METAMORPHOSIS ***Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions willbe renamed.Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyrightlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the UnitedStates without permission and without paying copyrightroyalties.
